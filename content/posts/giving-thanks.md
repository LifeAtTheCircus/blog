The 4th of July kind of reminds me of Thanksgiving.&#160; I think the two go hand and hand really.&#160; Because as we celebrate the birth of our nation, our independence and our freedom, how can we not give thanks?&#160; We have so much that we’ve grown to believe we’re entitled to all of it and more.&#160;&#160; 

In the midst of a fun filled day of family and friends, of parades, and flags, burgers and hot dogs, fire works and red-white-and-blue, I want to pause a few minutes to reflect.

We have so much.&#160; So, very, very, very much.&#160; 

I’m educated and have the right to educate my children how I see fit.&#160; I am allowed to worship whomever I want, however I choose without fear of my life.&#160; I feel safe.&#160; In fact, pretty much most of the time, I feel safe.&#160; I have a voice which can be heard.&#160; For so many woman in the world, this is not the case.&#160; 

I am thankful.&#160; Thankful for the sacrifices of men and women now and in the past to preserve our freedom.&#160; Thankful for our forefathers who founded this great nation with such wisdom.&#160; Thankful to be an American.&#160; Not because I think Americans are better than the rest of the world, but I do think we have it easier than the rest of the world.&#160;
