I think 4 is a great age for a lot of reasons… one of which is the funny little things 4 year olds say…

Today we were walking to the van and she was carrying her coat, Kit, and her baby.&#160; I said, “If you wear your coat you’ll have more hands.”&#160; to which she said, “No, Mom, I’ll still only have 2 hands.”&#160; 

Last week before she went into her gymnastics class I told her to work hard and have fun.&#160; “Oh Mom, that won’t be a problem at all… when I’m doing my back hip circle and I swing back from the bar and flip around, it’s just like I am flying through the air.”&#160; _The look of pure joy on her face as she described flying through the air is one I want to remember forever.&#160;_ 

A few weeks ago I served split pea soup for dinner.&#160; While my husband and sons both enjoyed it, my girls did not.&#160; AT ALL.&#160;&#160; I suppose somewhere during the dinner I said something about how I worked hard to make that meal for them and I didn’t appreciate their disgusted faces and comments about the food.&#160; And I suppose it sunk in a little even though they didn’t really eat it all that well.&#160; Because a whole week later out of the blue she says to me, “Mom, remember when you made that soup last week that I didn’t like?”&#160; “Well, it wasn’t that I didn’t like that you made it for me, it’s just that when it was in my mouth… pause… well…. when it was in my mouth it just made me feel like I had to cough.”&#160; (_essentially she said, “Mom it’s not that I didn’t appreciate your cooking me food, it’s just your food made me want to gag).&#160;_ 

**Seriously, I love this girl and am not at all eager for her to grow up anytime soon.**
