Ever tried to pack cupcakes in a lunch box?&#160; It creates a gooey mess all over the sandwich baggie and takes all the fun out of eating it when your hands are covered in icing.&#160; 

I saw this handy little trick in one of my studentâ€™s lunches back in my teaching days.&#160; 

Take your plain cupcake.

Slice it in half.

Take a glob of icing.

Spread it in the middle of the cupcake.

Push it back together.

And now you can stick it in the baggie without worrying about smearing icing all over the place. 

I typically set aside a few cupcakes each time I make them so my husband can enjoy one in his lunch.&#160; Icing the middle of the cupcakes totally [works for me](http://www.wearethatfamily.com) when packing cupcakes in his lunch.&#160;
