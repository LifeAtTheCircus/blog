[![IMG_7023](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-7023-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-7023.jpg) My hubby and I are huge Pittsburgh Steelers fans.  I was [born a Steelers fan](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/11/daddys-football-fan/).  My husband's allegiance was born in college when he began faithfully watching the home team in Western, PA.  There's no way to distinguish who is more devoted now, we are both hard core.   Living in Ravens territory is tough.  We watch every game televised here, head to [Glory Days](http://www.glorydaysgrill.com/) for big games that aren't televised, make a few treks to my parents house in PA, read the play by plays online, listen on the radio.... whatever we can to follow our team.  We've even had my parents record games and mail them to us to watch mid week.  

This year we went camping with my parents in Latrobe, Pa so we could attend Steelers Training Camp at St Vincents College.   

While I am sure the kids would have been just as excited to watch a high school game, Scott and I were both completely star struck.  

 

"Look, right there, that's Ben"

"He just threw it to Santonio Holmes."

"Son, that guy right there holds the record for the longest run in Super Bowl history!"

"Look, it's Heinz, there goes Heinz!"

"I found Polamalu... he's sitting in the back there."

"Holmes waved at me... I got a wave!"

We sounded like little kids as we stood on the field a mere 10 feet from [![IMG_6950](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-6950-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-6950.jpg)Super Bowl superstars.   We kept poking each other and snapping pictures and smiling and cheering.  It's our second time going and we both are eager to return again. It was worth the long drive, the [car sick baby](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/20/not-for-those-with-weak-stomachs-that-apparently-includes-my-youngest/), the traffic...  It was awesome to see players that we see on TV up close and personal.   It was fun to watch them joking around on the field with each other, to see them run drills, even watching them ride by in golf carts was a thrill (both Heinz Ward and Troy Polamalu rode right in front of us, literally 5 feet a way).  See what I mean by star struck?  

I know they are just people.  I know some of you may have no idea who any of these players are.  You might be rolling your eyes at my obsession asking why I care about a bunch of guys who get paid millions of dollars to throw a football and tackle each other.  To me it is more than a game.  [![IMG_7038](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-7038-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-7038.jpg) It's a bond I've had with my Dad for as long as I can remember.  It's a weekly date night with my hubby as we snuggle on the couch and watch the team play.  It's something to talk about that doesn't involve planning, house work, the kids... something entirely different.  And it is fun... really fun to watch them throw the Hail Mary pass down the field, to see them knock the ball right out of the guys hands, to watch them run it down the field for a touch down. 

We're ready for some football!!
