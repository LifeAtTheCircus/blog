I had a dream last night that I accidentally opened [the envelope](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/03/07/the-envelope/) and found out we were having a girl. 

If your wondering how one can accidentally open the envelope, it’s actually not to hard to do b/c yesterday I was cleaning out some papers to be filed and saw a sealed blank envelope and thought, “What is that?”&#160; Thankfully, before opening it, I saw the name of the sonogram office in the corner and realized what it was. 

Back to the dream….I felt so sick to my stomach as I had to tell Scott we made it till 2 weeks are left and now I knew.&#160; It was awful. 

I was so glad to wake up and realize I am still clueless!!&#160; I can’t imagine making it this long without knowing and then having found out like that. 

Now for the game…here are some preggo shots of me in each pregnancy.&#160; See if I carried similarly or differently.&#160;&#160;&#160; Place your bets as to what the newest circus member will be.&#160; You can even place bets on the size if your feeling so inclined.&#160; We’ll find out who is correct whenever this little circus member decides to make his or her debut!
