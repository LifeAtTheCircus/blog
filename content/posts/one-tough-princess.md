[![one tough princess](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/one-tough-princess-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/one-tough-princess.jpg)With Halloween in the air, I decided to post one of my favorite trick or treating pictures of my middle child.  It was taken last year when she a little over 18 mths old.  

 

She might have been little, but she could hold her own.   Check out the grip on her trick or treating pumpkin.  And the look on that face says, "No body go near my loot!" This isn't a damsel in distress kind of princess; she can handle things herself, thank you very much.
