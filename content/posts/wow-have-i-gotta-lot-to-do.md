If you’re anything like me then perhaps you’ve got a project or two that’s been sitting on the back burner for awhile… in the daily struggle to get dinner on the table and clean underwear out of the dryer, some how those bigger projects get pushed off until “later.”

Well, [Becky’s](http://everydaybecky.blogspot.com/2009/05/time-to-wow-again.html) got a carnival going on this week to inspire us to tackle those projects we’ve been meaning to get to, but haven’t. 

It’s called [WOW](http://everydaybecky.blogspot.com/2009/05/time-to-wow-again.html).&#160; And it began on Wednesday.&#160; Yes, I know it is Friday, but I am speedy like that.&#160; Always the first car in line at the preschool drop off, always returning library books before their due… ahem, yea not so much…this is life at the circus, remember? 

The premise of WOW is to pick one project that you will get done

.. Yea, she is so clever.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

So, being as it is Friday and I am now participating in WLTOW (within less than one week…not quite as catchy), I’ve got some work to do…

I hope to tackle my flower beds this week… Yes, all 5 of them.&#160; They need&#160; to be weeded, mulched, and some annuals planted.&#160; I’ve also been toying with the idea of planting some veggies.&#160; If that is ever going to happen, it needs to happen this week.&#160;

So, wish me luck.&#160; Because [green thumb](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/03/31/my-not-so-green-thumb/) I have not.&#160; 

And if you wanna play along,&#160; [go visit Becky](http://everydaybecky.blogspot.com/2009/05/time-to-wow-again.html).&#160; It’s not too late… you can join late like me… and then I won’t be the last one to play along!!
