A few weeks ago Scott and I attended the wedding of a friend of ours from high school.&#160; As we sat there watching, I had this rather startling realization.&#160; 

Weddings are different for me now than they used to be.&#160; I can remember going to wedding for friends when we were in college.&#160; As I rejoiced with our friends over the start of their life together, I also found myself taking note of things I’d like to do in my own wedding “someday.”&#160;&#160;&#160; Then in the years shortly after we were married, each wedding would instantly bring me back to our own.&#160; As I watched the bride walk down the aisle, I’d also look up to see the look on the groom’s face.&#160; I’d remember the way Scott looked at me on our wedding day.&#160; 

At this wedding when we watched the bride walk down the aisle, Scott leaned over and said, “Man, I am going to be a puddle on the floor when I walk our girls down the aisle.”&#160; When the father of the bride gave a speech at the reception and he talked about “what happened to his little girl who just yesterday was yea high”&#160; my throat constricted a bit in my chest as I thought of our own kids just yea high… and **then** the mother/son dance.&#160; Oh man… that dance has never been the same for me since I had my boys.&#160;&#160; Both sets of parents handled the day with great dignity and grace.&#160; I marveled at how they did it.&#160; 

And as I sat talking with Scott at the reception table, I realized the great paradigm shift which had occurred.&#160; Somewhere in the 12 years we’ve been married, we’ve found ourselves relating to the roles of parents of the bride and groom!&#160; How did that happen?&#160; There were still moments when we watched, that I was taken back to our special day.&#160; When they said their vows and exchanged their rings, I held Scott’s hands and remembered our own sacred vows.&#160; But, man, my heart found itself hurting for that momma as she danced with her boy!&#160; Much like most everything else life, my perspective is different now that I’m a mom myself.&#160; Weddings just aren’t the same as they used to be….they are so much more.&#160;
