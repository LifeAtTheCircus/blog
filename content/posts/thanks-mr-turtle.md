Every time we went to Target he would push the buttons to make it play music and he would ask if he could get it for his sister.  We didn't think it was necessary.

He was still insistent about it when our third child was born so we decided to let him get it for his sister for Christmas.  

He was right, we were wrong.  She loved it instantly.  She'd play with it when she woke up or as she was falling asleep.  

I always played a cd of lullaby music for my other two kids as they fell asleep.  This can sometimes be a pain when we are away from home, especially [camping](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/18/rained-out/), and we don't have access to a cd player.  With the baby we lay her down in her crib, push play on Mr Turtle, and it plays a little song for approx 15-20 seconds.  If she wants more music she hits it once or twice more.  It is portable, so we have brought it with us camping or on other over night trips.  It's easy for her to use so if she wakes up in the morning and can't fall back asleep she can push the button herself.  (Doesn't need Mom to get out of bed and come hit play on the cd player).  This fact alone makes it worth the $20 we spent on the toy.   I often hear the music playing in her room before it's time for her to wake up.  (Now that the crib is lowered and Mr Turtle rests on on the bottom, she sometimes rolls into it while sleeping and once we heard it playing continuously because her head was against it.  Didn't seem to bother her a bit though).  

Mr Turtle has provided a simple way for my baby to listen to music as she falls asleep, self sooth when she wakes up in the middle of the night, and easily provide the continuity of her normal routine when we are away from home.  It works for me!!  If your looking for more helpful tips, visit Shannon at [Rocks in My Dryer](http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/).
