A few months ago I didn’t now Bruce Banner from Bruce Wayne and I couldn’t have named an X-Man to save my life.&#160; 

Since [my son’s Spiderman party](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/20/my-little-spidey/), I’ve been studying up.&#160;&#160; Doing some self inflicted homework.&#160; 

In the past month I have seen all 3 Spiderman Movies, The Incredible Hulk, The Punisher, and the 3 X Men movies…and tomorrow Scott and I are going on a double date to see the new Wolverine movie.&#160; 

Before you go thinking I’m working for the mother of the year award, I gotta confess that while part of this did stem from a desire to be able to explain to my son who the bad guys were, the shocking thing is, I have&#160; really grown to like this whole super hero genre.&#160; 

I think it started a few years ago when I started watching [Heroes](http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/).&#160; It opened up a whole new world to me.

It’s called fantasy.

Prior to that, I really wasn’t into sci-fi or fantasy.&#160; 

*   never read Chronicles of Narnia or Harry Potter
*   slept through Star Wars in the theatre
*   don’t even get me started on those trekies.  

But after becoming a devoted follower of Heroes, I’ve grown to enjoy the uh, less than realistic fiction genres.&#160; 

This fall I devoured the Twilight novels.&#160; Never would have thought vampires to be my thing.&#160; 

And this spring I moved on to the world of comic books. 

Only really I just watch the movies.&#160; In crazy multi day movie marathon format… This week it’s been X-men Sun, Mon, Tues, Wed, and Thurs…when I wake up in the middle of the night dreaming of mutants, you will know why.&#160; 

While I still enjoy a good ol’ Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks romantic comedy, I must confess that I would rather watch Xavier and his crew battle Magneto over a multi disk set of Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility _any day of the week.&#160;_ And in fact I am willing to bet I could name more Marvel bad guys for you than I could characters in Jane Austen novels.&#160; 

Any other Super Hero fans out there?
