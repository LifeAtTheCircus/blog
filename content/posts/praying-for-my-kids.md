A few years ago a woman from my church passed out [these prayer cards](http://www.navpress.com/product/9781576839003/31-Biblical-Virtues-to-Pray-for-Your-Kids) written by Bob Hostetler to the ladies in our MOPS group.&#160; Each card had 31 Biblical Virtues to pray for your children, with verses included.&#160; 

I thought this was a great idea and instantly tucked it away inside my Bible. 

Only to forget about it and lose track of it with all the other papers stuffed in there. 

While doing some cleaning recently I stumbled across the card again and decided to put it up on my fridge instead.&#160; Because the kitchen is pretty much the center of my home and where I spend the majority of my time it seems.&#160; 

With the card up on my fridge, I see it throughout the day and am prompted to pray for that days virtue for my children.&#160; I am so excited to pray more specifically for my kids.&#160; Not only does the card help me with that, but it also has helped me to focus in on the traits that I want to be instilling in my children.&#160; It serves as a great reminder to me of what we are striving for.&#160; 

I’ve also gone through the list and picked out a specific trait that I am consistently praying for each individual child.&#160; They are traits that I see them currently struggling with and it has helped me to focus on working on that with that child. 

So, we are working on self-control for one, kindness for another, and respect for a third.&#160; With these in mind, when I discipline them and correct them I am trying to really hone in on those virtues and also to praise them when I see them exhibiting these traits.&#160;&#160;&#160; As they grow, or as new needs arise, I am sure I will find other traits to focus on, but for right now, these are the areas I am concentrating on with each individual child. 

And I love the prayers that go with them… just listen… (or read, I suppose)

For self control:&#160; “Father help my children not to be like many others around them, but let them be alert and self-controlled in all they do.”&#160; 1 Thes 5:6

For kindness:&#160; “Lord, may my children always to try to be kind to each other and to everyone else.”&#160; 1 Thes. 5:15

For respect:&#160; “Father grant that my children may show proper respect to everyone, as your Word commands.”&#160; 1 Peter 2:17

There are so many wonderful prayers on here… for salvation, love for God’s word, heart for missions, courage, purity… it really has been a wonderful tool for me over the past few weeks and I hope to keep up with it.&#160; 

I want to be an intentional and prayerful mother.&#160; That is my goal.&#160; Some days I just survive and make it through, but this little card on my fridge, is helping give focus and direction to my mothering. 

If your interested in the card, you can [click here](http://www.reviveourhearts.com/downloads/index.php?id=9479) and download the card for free.&#160;&#160; I highly suggest putting it in a place you look at often, as that has definitely [worked for me](http://www.wearethatfamily.com) in following through with the prayers.
