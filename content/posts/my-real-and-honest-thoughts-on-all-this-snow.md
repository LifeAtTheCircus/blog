If your from the midatlantic region (as most of my readers are, b/c I think most of my readers stalk me from facebook) then you have probably seen and read and heard all you want about snow this past week.&#160;&#160; 

Seriously, I have scrolled through and looked at gazillions of pictures of face book friends back decks overflowing with snow and seen kids waste high in it, which is kind of funny since I can look out my own windows and see the very same images.&#160; 

And if you aren’t from around here, then you may not have a clue what’s going on.&#160; Because I’ll be honest… I don’t know what the weather in FL or Idaho or CA is doing right now.&#160; 

As I [mentioned before,](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/02/06/a-winter-unlike-any-ive-ever-seen/) we’ve had a crazy winter.&#160; 2 MAJOR snowstorms in one winter… a true anomaly here with another blizzard warning issued for tomorrow. 

For real?&#160; Another 6-20 (depending on which site you go to) on top of the almost 2 feet I have sitting out in my yard!!!! [![image002](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image002.jpg "image002")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image002.jpg) And I thought rather than share with you more pictures of my kids trudging through mounds and mounds of snow (as I am sure I will have for you tomorrow) I thought I’d come clean and share my real thoughts on this upcoming snowstorm.

eh

Care to stroll with me down memory lane and track my attitude regarding this historic winter wonderland we’re experiencing?&#160; 

When the [first storm came](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/12/20/snow-what-fun-2/) in December… I was all, “this is so magical, right before Christmas”&#160; play the Christmas music, bake cookies, make cinnamon rolls, lament we don’t have a fireplace… I am LOVING LIFE!!!&#160; This is great!&#160; I love being snowed in with my family.&#160; This is romantic and old fashioned and right out of a book.&#160; [Remember my posts](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/12/19/and-since-theres-no-place-to-go/) and my pictures just oozing with holiday joy and exuberance?

2 months later, forecasters are saying we’re going to get hit with another storm.&#160; This time on the day we had planned to have my daughter’s 4th birthday party.&#160;&#160; Insert slight stress.&#160; Do we postpone the party?&#160; Is it really going to hit?&#160; What do I do?&#160; Why this weekend?&#160; Why not last weekend or next weekend?&#160; Ugh… what do I do?&#160; Check accuweather….. 2 hrs later… check accuweather again… finally decide to post pone her party 1 week.&#160;&#160; Second guess if we made the right call.&#160; Check accuweather again… YUP, snow is coming… def made the right call.&#160; My attitude then became, “Well, since we already cancelled and there is no turning back, this better be a good storm… I am ready to embrace it!”&#160; Stock up on food, bake cookies… this is going to be fun!!!&#160; Wait…. what if we lose power?&#160; That is not fun… so I fill tubs with water for flushing toilets, make sure we have gallons of drinking water and a pot of water on the stove for cooking, make sure the dishes are all caught up and we have paper plates…. Scott tries to get our generator working.&#160; Still about 80% excited with 20% fearful that we’ll lose power… losing power in my mind takes all the fun and joy out of a blizzard. 

We don’t lose power.&#160; Hooray!!&#160; Go outside, take lots of pics…. talk to neighbors, drink lots of hot chocolate…. life is good. 

Then Monday comes and Scott goes back to work and we go back to school.&#160; (advantage/disadvantage of homeschooling…. depending on how you look at it)&#160; There is still snow outside but honestly, it is now much less romantic.&#160; With Scott at work, I have no desire to bundle up three kids and take them outside.&#160; So, in my D- momness… we stay inside.&#160; Because they didn’t ask, so I figured, eh why push them?&#160; I know, I know… I am a bad mom.&#160; But they were happy inside.&#160; For some reason beyond my comprehension they have been wearing their bathing suits every day this week and pretending to swim in the living room.&#160; Yesterday they were burying each other under pillows and rescuing one another and then doctoring each other up.&#160; They played nicely for HOURS…. why would I interrupt that so we could get cold and wet, if I didn’t have to?&#160;&#160;&#160; Really, why? Won’t the snow still be there tomorrow?&#160; 

[![IMG_5549](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_5549.jpg "IMG_5549")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_5549.jpg) 

Yup…. snow still here….. and guess what?&#160; Now they are calling for anywhere between 6-12 and 10-20 more inches of snow between tonight and tomorrow.&#160; 

And now…now, I am much less excited.&#160; 

Because Scott still doesn’t think his work will be closed.&#160; (times like these I wish he was a gov’t employee)&#160; and now I am afraid again of losing power…something about high winds and blizzard like conditions…. and it’s not a weekend…. and well, we’ve had fun in the snow.&#160; But, really, 
I enjoy snow the most from my kitchen window while baking chocolate chip cookies and sipping hot cocoa
.&#160; 

There it is, the cold, harsh truth.

I am not a snow bunny.&#160; Nor am I a super mom.

And while I have no desire to be a snow bunny, I do aspire to make wonderful memories with my family. 

So……. even though I am much less excited about this forecast, and even though I am faking it a little, I am still going to do my best to embrace this next round of winter weather.&#160;&#160; [Aunt Karen and Eli](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/) have not gone back to Texas yet, so we invited them over tonight to get snowed in with us.&#160; I am going to make home made pizza for dinner tonight and after nap time today we’re going out in the front yard to play for a bit in the snow.&#160; I plan to have cinnamon rolls ready for breakfast tomorrow and I think we’re going to bake snowman/snowflake sugar cookies tomorrow (since we just had a batch of chocolate chip cookies this weekend and decorating sugar cookies is one of my kids favorite things to do).&#160; Before I go to sleep tonight I will fill the tubs with water and make sure the dishes are clean.&#160;&#160; I am sure we’ll take more pics tomorrow of the crazy amounts of snow in our yard and Scott will once again shovel out a spot for our cars in the driveway either before he goes to work or after he gets home.

But, I thought that before I post that next batch of winter fun pictures, I should come clean and tell you that while we are enjoying this winter wonderland…. there is still part of me that, well, isn’t as giddy as I once was.&#160; And I strive to keep it real here folks.
