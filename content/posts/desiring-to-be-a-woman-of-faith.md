Years ago my Mom and I attended a [Women of Faith](http://www.womenoffaith.com/) Conference…I believe our first was when I was in college.&#160; We drove to Cleveland, OH to attend the conference.&#160; We left refreshed and inspired and vowing to make it a tradition to attend some sort of spiritual conference together as often as we could.&#160;&#160; Since then, we’ve attend Women of Faith, Beth Moore, and a few women’s retreats together.&#160; I appreciate the opportunity to worship, and grow alongside my mom.&#160;&#160; Our faith and our ability to encourage each other in our spiritual walks, is one of my favorite aspects of my relationship with my mom.&#160; It is something I have treasured since middle school when we first did a mother/daughter Bible study together.&#160; 

When [BookSneeze](http://www.booksneeze.com) offered the opportunity to attend a local Women of Faith conference and blog about it, I jumped at the opportunity.&#160; When they offered me 2 tickets to the conference in DC, I knew instantly who I wanted to go with.&#160; 

I am very excited about attending the [Women of Faith](http://www.womenoffaith.com/) conference later this month.&#160; I have to confess I have been negligent lately in my personal quiet time and I am looking to get back on track.&#160; I am eager for some encouragement and inspiration in my personal walk with the Lord.&#160;&#160;&#160; But from past experience, my favorite part of the conference is typically the worship.&#160; There is something quite powerful about worshipping in an arena full of other women.&#160;&#160; I am also so happy that my mom is able to get off of work and come down to attend with me.&#160; I look forward to the quality one on one time with her (something that I just don’t get enough of anymore… especially now that I am a mother myself) as we travel to and from the conference each day.&#160;
