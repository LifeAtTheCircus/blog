Time for another [Sincerley Fro' Me To You Post.](http://wearethatfamily.com) Since my baby turns one this month, I thought I'd share a pregnancy anecdote with you.  

In January of last year my good friend told me she was pregnant with her third child.  Her oldest son is 10 months younger than my son, and the two of them are good buddies.  Her second son is 4 months younger than my middle child.  After telling me her news, she said, "Crystal, you gotta do this with me."   I replied that while my husband and I knew we wanted a third child,  I wasn't sure if we were quite ready.

2 weeks later I called and asked her how hard she'd been praying.  

I was pregnant!

2 weeks after that my husband and I went for a dating sonogram, thinking we were around 9 weeks.  When we looked at the screen my husband and I both exclaimed, "It looks like a real baby!"  I am sure the tech thought we were morons, "what did we expect to see?"   But, I was thinking I was around 9 weeks and 9 week sonograms look a lot more like baby lima beans.  We could see our baby's hands and feet and head... we knew instantly that we were farther along than we thought.  Turns out we were 15 weeks. We thought they baby would be due sometime in Sept or Oct, only to learn that our baby would be joining us in July! I had "skipped" my entire first trimester!!  

I called my friend from the parking lot to inform her that not only was I going to be pregnant with her, but I was due a month before her!!  Here we are showing off our pregnant bellies last summer!
