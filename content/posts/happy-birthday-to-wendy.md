Yesterday the family celebrated our beloved pup’s 1st birthday.&#160; We gave her a giant bone at lunch and after dinner we all enjoyed some Wendy’s Jr Frosties…. seemed fitting.&#160; We even presented her with a new squeak toy.

I have never been a dog person, though I have appreciated the canine members of our house.&#160; There is something about watching a pup patiently accept the rough love of a toddler that warms a Momma’s heart.&#160;

Wendy has snuggled her way into my heart in a way I never expected though.&#160; I don’t love her simply b/c she is good to my kids.&#160; Though she is. 

I just love her. 

She’s become my shadow.&#160; Quite literally.&#160; Where ever I go, she goes.&#160; Down to the basement to switch a load of laundry she’s there…. Back to the kitchen to prep dinner, she’s laying on my feet while I am using the mixer.&#160; Teaching school, she’s snuggled under the table sleeping.&#160; She even scratches at the door to the bathroom if I forget to let her in with me.&#160; She sits beside the tub, every day when I take my shower.&#160; Reading a book on the couch or watching a movie in the basement, she’s by side. And she sleeps on our bed every night.&#160; And while she has developed a few rather annoying habits (like barking every time a noise startles her, viciously attacking the vacuum every time I use it, and peeing whenever Scott greets her when he comes in the door…) even with all of those less admirable qualities… I realize I love her.&#160; I truly love her.&#160; I can’t imagine going through the day without her by my side.&#160;&#160;&#160; Though it’s safe to say I don’t really like dogs in general, I genuinely adore and love Wendy.&#160; I am grateful to have her as part of our family.

Happy Birthday Wendy!&#160; Here’s to many more years with you as my shadow.
