Tuesday we left New Mexico and headed south west for Saguaro National Park in Tuscon, AZ.

We got to Saguaro National Park in time to explore a bit and then take in the parks beauty after the oppressive heat of the day was past. It really was perfect timing.&#160;&#160;&#160; We walked around a path near the visitors center which allowed us to see the cacti up close.&#160;

The cacti were much bigger than we expected and we were delighted to find some in bloom.&#160;&#160; The white blooms were particularly exciting because we learned that the white blooms only open up for one day and then they die.

We also got to see a few other things up close.&#160;&#160; Yes, I was totally freaked out by this snake.&#160; But, if I may say so myself, I remained calm.&#160;&#160; And even stayed on the trail rather than running back to the van shrieking like I wanted to do.

While on our walk, the sun’s “golden hour” appeared.&#160; It really was quite breathtaking.

Everyone enjoyed taking pictures during our evening stroll.
