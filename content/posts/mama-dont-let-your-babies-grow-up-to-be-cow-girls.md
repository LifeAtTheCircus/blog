My recent trip to Dallas, prompted me to bring home some cowboy/girl hats for my kiddos and as I snapped pictures of them playing dress up, I was reminded of some pictures from my past which look very similar.   

 

 

 

 

 

In the picture below, I am on a riding horse with a _cowgirl like hat_ at around 17 mths... a mere  2 mths older than my baby girl. Like the old Polaroid picture?  I know I could have cropped it out, but doesn't it look more authentic and antique like with it looking like the original?

Here's my baby girl in her hat.

A few years later my parents got me the whole ensemble... Same pony, but check out the hat, shirt, and skirt!  Don't I look like the next Annie Oakley?

Not sure what happened to the rest of her outfit... clearly, she is not as properly dressed as I was at that age!  

You'd think by these pictures that my family is from the midwest or something... wouldn't know we are east coasters through and through.  No draaaawls or ya'lls heard round' these parts!

It's fun to pretend though...
