I was scrolling around on pinterest one night and a [graphic](http://www.cartoonaday.com/left-brain-right-brain-illustration/) caught my eye that made me stop in my tracks.&#160; It showed 2 sides of the brains and listed descriptions for left/brain right brain people.&#160;

I think often people are largely a little bit of both.&#160; However, when I looked at this graphic, it was like a portrait of my daughters. 

 I swear my 6 year old could be the poster child for the left brained person.

And equally astonishing to me was the fact that as I looked closely at the adjectives for the right brained person, I found my 5 year old fit it TO THE TEE!

As I think back to the post I did this summer describing her personality… [this was her.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2012/07/24/my-5-year-old/)&#160; 

I am astonished that both girls could be SO DIFFERENT.&#160; While my boys appear to be more blends of both, my girls are quite distinct in their personalities.&#160; 

I see it in the way they organize their stuff, they way they dress, they way they keep their rooms, do their school work, even do their gymnastics.&#160; I found it interesting to read up on both personalities and learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of both.&#160;&#160; To be sure, I can’t parent them exactly the same way.&#160; [![IMG_6310](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_6310.jpg "IMG_6310")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_6310.jpg)

Given that they are a grade a part in school and only a year and a half apart in age, they share a lot of their life together.&#160; I think it will be good for them to have their own distinct identities and I hope they will learn to work together with someone completely opposite from them.&#160; They have no choice since they share a room/dresser and sometimes bed with each other.&#160;
