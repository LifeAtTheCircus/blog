Sometimes little snippets of the extraordinary appear in the midst of everyday life.&#160; Right smack in the middle of a messy kitchen with trashcans overflowing, and kids walking around half naked, a conversation took place at our dining room table.&#160; 

Scott was having eggnog with the two oldest children and I had gotten the video camera out to catch my littlest one playing with the tripod.&#160; She was walking around setting up the tripod and exclaiming, “Cheese.”&#160; I wasn’t able to catch her saying it when the camera was on her but during this time, a conversation began which I soon realized I just might want to record.&#160; Scott asked my son what the most important thing was…his answer touched our hearts.&#160; 

You’ll have to excuse the fact that all of our kids are half naked (we’d had pasta for dinner that night so I had taken off their shirts).&#160; And I have no idea why my little girl is walking around with an empty milk carton in her stroller, we do have baby dolls, I promise.&#160; Of course this most precious father/son conversation couldn’t have taken place on a night when the kids were dressed nicely (or even fully dressed for that matter) but that’s the circus life for you! And that is most certainly not the most important thing. 

Take a few minutes and listen to what my four year old son said is the most important thing…
  









  

 This conversation is a gift that we will cherish forever.&#160; I am so thankful I was able to capture it and record it.&#160; He knows the most important thing and that is all a parent could ask for.
