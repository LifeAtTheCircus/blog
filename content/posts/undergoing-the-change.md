Sometimes the music in my car radio really serves as nothing more than background noise to the chattering or squabbling going on in the back seat and the to do lists and other random thoughts going on in my brain.&#160; 

One day though something about the lyrics caused me to take pause and listen.&#160; I turned the radio up and even though I’ve heard the song countless times before, I listened to it for the first time. 

It was called “The Change” by Steven Curtis Chapman. 
  > Well I got myself a T-shirt that says what I believe        
> I got letters on my bracelet to serve as my ID         
> I got the necklace and the key chain         
> And almost everything a good Christian needs, yeah         
> I got the little Bible magnets on my refrigerator door         
> And a welcome mat to bless you before you walk across my floor         
> I got a Jesus bumper sticker         
> And the outline of a fish stuck on my car         
> And even though this stuff's all well and good, yeah         
> I cannot help but ask myself
> 
> What about the change        
> What about the difference         
> What about the grace         
> What about forgiveness         
> What about a life that's showing         
> I'm undergoing the change, yeah         
> I'm undergoing the change
> 
> Well I've got this way of thinking that comes so naturally        
> Where I believe the whole world is revolving around me         
> And I got this way of living that I have to die to every single day         
> 'Cause if God's Spirit lives inside of me, yeah
> 
> I'm gonna live life differently        
> I'm gonna have the change         
> I'm gonna have the difference         
> I'm gonna have the grace         
> I'm gonna have forgiveness         
> I'm gonna live a life that's showing         
> I'm undergoing the change  


It made me think about the way we as Christians portray ourselves to the world around us.&#160; So often we are concerned with letting everyone know we are Christians and making sure we look like “good” Christians.&#160; But, I can’t help but think that if we spent our time and energy living our lives as Christ did, then they would be able to tell without us having to tell them.&#160;&#160; They could see God’s work in our lives by our actions.&#160;&#160; It is my prayer that those I encounter in my life would notice the change taking place in my life.&#160; And that then I would be “_prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope you have_.” (1 Peter 3:15)
