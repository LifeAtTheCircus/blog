I’ve been a mom of three for almost two years and I have yet to figure out how to successfully take a good pic of my three kids together.&#160; And yet, I keep trying…call me hopelessly optimistic, stubborn, or just plain slow to learn, but I keep holding out hope that one day I’ll snap that illustrious shot of my circus crew. 

Here we have two sideward glances with a smirk and one squinter in the sun.

Mom, puh-leeze, can we just get back to picking strawberries?

This might be my fav… a look of disgust, a pucker and a closed eye shot.
