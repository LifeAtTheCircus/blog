We had an incident a few weeks ago at the park.  One of those, turn your back for one seconds, incidents.  The kids were frolicking in the grass and I turned to look at the baby, when I turned back my two year old was gone.  

After suffering the sick feeling of panic in my stomach and running around like a crazy mama I heard her crying.  She had fallen down during her frolic and I couldn't see her in the tall grass.  

All was well, but Mommy and Daddy were a bit shaken up and thanking the Lord for His protection.  

When we got home my son told me he was getting ready to run and rescue her like a super hero.  I commented on how brave he was and how God had given him to his sisters as their specially appointed super hero to watch out and and protect them.  

I was feeling pretty proud of myself as I used this opportunity to stress the importance of brothers taking care of their sisters... good mommy stuff...  

Then he looks up at me and says, "But Mommy, Daddy is their super hero!"

"Indeed he is", I said, "but you can be Daddy's helper."
