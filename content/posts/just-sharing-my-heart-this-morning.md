Been sorting through the kids clothes, bagging up the stuff too small, cleaning out stuff in the nursery....      
&#160;

I am so sad.      

It is so weird to think we might be done having babies.... so strange.... so sad.... I feel on the brink of tears.&#160; 

I have been trying all week to mentally prepare that we&#160; might be done, to figure out how to clean out the stuff and move on, but it is a lot harder than I thought. 

I thought&#160; I&#160; could be ok with it.... I am not sure.&#160;
