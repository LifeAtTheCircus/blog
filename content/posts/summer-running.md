Last week I registered for a 10 mile run at the end of August.  For over a year now I've been wanting to do this.  I ran a 5K for the first time when my son was a year old.  I ran two more when my 2 year old was 6 mths old.  Until last Tuesday, I hadn't run since.  

I waited through one of the mildest winter and spring seasons I've seen here and decided to start running during the week of record breaking heat.  Yup, I'm a smart cookie.  

I am following [Hal Higdon's](http://www.halhigdon.com/15Ktraining/15Knovsch.htm) guide to training for a 15K.  If I stick with the program, I'll be all set in time for my race, with even 2 weeks to spare.  Good thing I had those cushions worked in there because last week I went strong on Mon and Tues and then when the [power went out](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/05/no-electricity-water-or-internet/) on Wed, I kinda got off track.  I used the excuse that I didn't want to excercise if I couldn't shower afterwards.  It made sense until Friday when the power came back on and I still didn't go running.  

So Monday, I was back to trying out week one.  So far this week I've followed the schedule on Mon, Tues, and Thurs.  I had to run 2 miles each time this week, so I am a mere 1/5 of the way toward my goal.  Next week I am up to 3 miles which is pretty much the most I ever ran in my life.  I am intimidated by this goal, but will feel SO great 
if
 when I accomplish it.  

So far I've learned a few things from the process.  

*   You shouldn't go running in the morning on trash days.  The stink of garbage lingers in the trashcans even after the trash has been taken.
*   Running with an MP3 player makes the run pass much more quickly.
*   Having accountability to exercise makes a HUGE difference (Thanks Karen and Jen for registering with me!)  
I'm sure as the summer progresses, I'll have more profound wisdom to pass on to you.
