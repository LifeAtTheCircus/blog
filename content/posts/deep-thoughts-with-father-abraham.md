Ya know the kids song, "[Father Abraham](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VemLzV53FLg)"?  It's typically popular with Sunday School and VBS kids everywhere.  When I taught third grade it was a fav of my students.  

Not such a hit with my four year old.  I've said he's analytical, and he proved that point.

We're driving along in the minivan listening to a Kids Praise CD when "Father Abraham" comes on.  I'm singing along in my head not really paying much attention when my son asks, "Why does it say I am one of them?"

Me:  Well because Abraham was the Father of many people.  He had sons who had sons who had son who had sons who had you.

Son:  But you and Daddy are my parents, I am not Abraham's son

Me:  Well, I think it is talking about Abraham being the Father of God's people

(Honestly, I have never given this much thought to the song).

Pause...while song continues...

Son:  And what do they mean by right arm?  What's it talking about?

Me:  Well it's just a gesture you can do while your listening to the song.  I attempt to show him the gestures while driving down the road.  You can picture me swinging my arms and stomping my feet.  

He is not impressed.      

AT.ALL.

Me:  It's just a fun song.  

Son:  No comment

 

Sheesh, tough crowd, huh?  In all seriousness, I am grateful that he listens to the words of the song.  I'm glad he asks questions and doesn't just accept everything he hears as fact.  I hope and pray that this continues through his adolescent years.   In the mean time, I am working hard to as 1 Peter 3:15 states, to "_be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have_."   As a mother, I need to be sharp and ready with answers for my children and I need to seize these opportunities in the midst of every day life to teach my children.
