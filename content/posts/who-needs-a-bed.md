I’ve written before about the crazy places and positions I’ve found my kids sleeping in.&#160; It appears child number 4 is no exception to the random sleeping locations of the circus crew. 

Last night, when I went upstairs for bed, I found him asleep in his door way like this.

Today at nap time, I again went up the stairs to find him out of his room. [![IMG_5694](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_5694.jpg "IMG_5694")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_5694.jpg)

It appears he’s taken a preference for sleeping in the hallway/landing area of our home.&#160;&#160; _Because, really when you want comfort, who doesn’t think Berber carpet?_

I feared however, this would prove a problem when his sister came out of her room before he was ready to wake from his nap, so I moved him back to his bed before it was too late.&#160; Thankfully, my timing was pretty good as he stirred slightly and settled back to sleep.&#160;
