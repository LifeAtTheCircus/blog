My girls, especially my youngest, love to change clothes.&#160; And often.&#160; It borders on ridiculous.&#160; I knew if I didn’t document it, no one would believe me.

So, take a look at Thursdays attire here at the circus. (I will mention that we never left the house today).&#160; 

The day started at **7:00am**, didn’t have the camera ready then, but here she is at **8:30am**.&#160; (wearing the clothes she wore last night plus a coat)

 This lasted all of 18 minutes because by **8:59am** she traded swim suits with her big sister

 By **10:57 am**, she added her winter boots, hat, and mittens.&#160; She was determined to go outside, but didn’t make it past the door.&#160; (hmmm… wonder why)

 At **11:17am** (20&#160; minutes later) she discovered the too short Winnie the Pooh sailor dress from last summer that I keep trying to hide and she keeps discovering.&#160;

 Thankfully the scandalous dress didn’t last long as she changed into her lady bug pajamas at **11:42am.**

15 minutes later at **11:57am** she again had donned the hat and boots and was ready yielding a rather dangerous looking light saber.

She then changed into her leotard and accessorized with my high heel shoes at **12:33pm**.

[![IMG_6256](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_6256.jpg "IMG_6256")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_6256.jpg) She napped in her leotard (hence the 3 hour reprieve on outfit changes).&#160; Upon waking up at **3:33** she decided to change back into her lady bug pajammies.

[![IMG_6262](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_6262.jpg "IMG_6262")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_6262.jpg) By **5:20pm** however she was back into her sisters bathing suit and they were having swim class on the living room floor (note her sister is wearing her brothers bathing suit…apparently all bathing suits are up for grabs here).&#160; 

[![IMG_6264](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_6264.jpg "IMG_6264")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_6264.jpg)&#160;

At **5:40pm**, I discovered her sporting her Dora and Boots undies, but decided it best not to post such a picture on the internet. 

Since Daddy was coming home soon, I prompted her to put on some clothes.&#160; Here she is helping with dinner at **6:10pm** in an actual shirt and pants!!

But, Daddy didn’t get home in time to see his daughter in real clothes because by **6:38pm** she was back in the “bubble bathing suit”

[![IMG_6272](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_6272.jpg "IMG_6272")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_6272.jpg)&#160;

She ate in the bubble suit and kept it on until bedtime when she changed into her “footie pajamas” at **8:04pm**

[![IMG_6276](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_6276.jpg "IMG_6276")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_6276.jpg)&#160;

13 hours and 13 outfits changes…seriously, this kiddo has more costume changes than a Broadway star. And I promise, this is a normal day…including the multiple changes and the preference for swim suits and pajamas…
