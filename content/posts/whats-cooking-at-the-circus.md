[![mpm-1](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/mpm1.jpg "mpm-1")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/mpm1.jpg) I have found that by planning my meals for the month, I can drastically reduce our families grocery spending.&#160;&#160; It takes time and a whole lot of effort though.&#160; And to be honest the past several months I wasn’t so good about it.&#160; But, then Scott and I sat down and took a look at our spending.&#160; And we realized that we needed to be a whole lot better about sticking to our budget.&#160; 

And so, the first thing I did at the beginning of the month is sit down with google calendar and plan out my meals.&#160; I made my grocery list based on this meal plan.&#160; Then I took a trip to Walmart to stock up on a months worth of groceries.&#160; I kid you not three separate people looked at me and my overflowing cart and one actually laughed at it.&#160; 

Some may think planning your meals out for a month isn’t flexible enough.&#160; Basically, it is a rough estimate.&#160; I can still switch things up a bit, but I know that aside from milk and produce, I have everything I need for the months worth of meals.&#160; If I want to switch the meal from the 13 to the 27th, there is not rule saying I can’t.&#160; And I don’t have to wrack my tired brain at 5:00 each day trying to figure out what we’re having for dinner. 

We’re half way through the month and so far we’re on pace for sticking with the January grocery budget!&#160; So, I thought I’d share what’s working for us at the circus as well as our meal plan for the week.&#160; 

**Sunday**- breakfast for dinner:&#160; waffles

**Monday**- lasagna, rolls, green beans

**Tuesday**- dinner at a friends house, I’m bringing dessert… any suggestions? I am trying to make something without having to go out and buy any new ingredients…otherwise, I’d totally make [this.](http://grshortstop.blogspot.com/2010/01/pretzel-ice-cream-pie.html)&#160; Anyone have a yummy desert recipe I can make with ingredients you have on hand around the house? 

**Wednesday**- [Sarah’s Creamy Broccoli Cheese Soup](http://grshortstop.blogspot.com/2009/10/creamy-broccoli-cheese-soup.html), home made rolls

**Thursday**- I am going out for a girls night with my [SIL](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/) and good friend… we’re eating at [Chipotle](http://www.chipotle.com), then watching [this movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1142433/synopsis), and enjoying some “[Gilmore Girls style](http://www2.warnerbros.com/gilmoregirls/)” junk food.&#160; 

The fam, however, will be eating pepperoni bread, applesauce, and corn.

**Friday**- [chicken pot pie](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/chicken-pot-pie-iv/detail.aspxhttp://allrecipes.com/recipe/chicken-pot-pie-iv/detail.aspx) (or as my kids call it… vegetable pie…they are excited b/c it is [sure to make their ears taste disgusting](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/12/02/where-is-he-going-with-this/))

**Saturday**-&#160; French toast, sausage
