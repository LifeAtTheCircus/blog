We had a fun weekend at the circus… Friday night swim, Saturday included a trip to the mall to spend birthday money and allowances, Father/Son set up for cub scout day camp week ahead, afternoon at the gym for the girls Open House… and Sunday was filled with a great morning of worship, friends over for the afternoon, and my 7 year old got to perform with her gymnastics friends at the opening of the Baysox game!&#160; FUN-FUN-FUN!&#160; 

It was really neat to see the girls perform together.&#160; This Momma’s heart swelled up with pride as I watched them stretch side by side in their matching leos.&#160; This year is the first year with them both on team and they have really enjoyed going to practice together.&#160;

One fun part of the Open House is that in addition to seeing the girls do a little performance, everyone gets a chance to try out the gym equipment.&#160; Our three year old was SO excited that he got to go in the gym too.&#160; He asked his sister if he could wear her “leo” but she kindly explained it wouldn’t fit him… we then pretended his Spiderman shirt was his leo.&#160; It took him a little while to warm up to it all, but he had a blast running down the tumble track, hanging on the bar and jumping in the pit just like his sisters.&#160; Afterwards he said to me, “So Monday are you gonna drop me off for practice with the girls?”&#160;

Sunday my 7 year old got to perform a demonstration at the beginning of the Baysox Baseball game.&#160; (local minor league baseball team).&#160; [![IMG_5791](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_5791.jpg "IMG_5791")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_5791.jpg)

It was fun to see the girls doing their handstands and back hand springs up on the Jump Tron.&#160; [![IMG_5812](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_5812.jpg "IMG_5812")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_5812.jpg)

Then we stayed and watched the game with some of her gym friends.&#160; Then at the end she got to run the bases!
