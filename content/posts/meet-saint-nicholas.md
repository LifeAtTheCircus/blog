My son often refers to Santa as Saint Nicholas.  I guess it's because of reading _Jolly Old Saint Nicholas_ and _Twas the Night Before Christmas_.

This week my son decided he wanted to pretend to be Saint Nicholas. 

Meet Jolly Old Saint Nick himself...

Check out his sleigh (the blanket...see him holding the reigns?) and note the stuffed bear playing the roll of reindeer.

Filling the stockings...

If you're good, you too could get an empty egg carton and a plastic lid.

Hmm, holding out for the real guy on the 24th?

I guarantee [he](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3329529856/tt0039628) isn't as cute as our Santa!
