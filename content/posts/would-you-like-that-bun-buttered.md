 My husband was grilling burgers for dinner the other day.  I had set the buns out on the counter to defrost earlier in the day.  I'd also set out a stick of butter because I planned to bake cookies this weekend and knew I'd need the butter to be soft.  

I had seen my 2 year old daughter over by the counter asking about the bread, but I didn't pay that much attention.  

When I went to give the buns for my husband, this is what I found.

Nice, huh?  Anyone want a slightly mauled buttered bun for their burger?

Ah, the joys of dining with toddlers.
