Reading has not come without its share of battles and tears for my son.&#160; Last year, he truly HATED to read and it was such a struggle for us.&#160; I at times found myself wondering if I was really meeting his needs by homeschooling.&#160; Part of me kept telling myself, “He is a boy.&#160; He’ll get it, it just takes time.&#160; Don’t worry.”&#160; But another part said, “Am I doing a good enough job?&#160; Should I push more?&#160; Should I put him in school instead?”&#160; 

I tried all sorts of ways to make it more fun (like cramming my 9 month preggo body onto the floor of our closet).&#160; I also started using incentives… like “read 10 books and you get a date with mom.”&#160; (Hello frappuchinos!)&#160; This worked some, but honestly, sometimes 10 books seemed like too loft of a goal. 

I then stumbled across a carrot which worked wonderfully. 

Gum

He and his sisters got a piece of gum if he read a book that day.&#160; This worked well b/c the girls became instant encouragers… “Have you read your book yet today?&#160; Let’s get our gum!”&#160; 

During the summer, I also had a friend whom I respect greatly, who has worked as a reading resource teacher with the county for years, evaluate him for me.&#160; She graciously did and she instilled me with a great dose of confidence that yes, he was doing ok, and she even gave me some pointers for how to help him.

Fast forward 7 months and he is now a reading machine!

This December he brought home a book from the prize box at his tutorial.&#160; It was called “The Wisdom of Solomon” and it was about a little Amish boy named Solomon.&#160; Never in a million years would I have picked that book out for my son.&#160; But, it was a turning point for him.&#160; He was so excited about it.&#160; Truthfully, it was a bit above his reading level, but I figured it couldn’t hurt.&#160; He was thrilled to have his own book and he would pick it up and read it to himself from time to time.&#160; Sure, he didn’t get every word on the page correct, but he did get the basic gist of each chapter.&#160;

 He is so, so excited and proud about reading that he happily chooses to read as he falls asleep at night, when he wakes up in the morning, and during quiet time in the afternoon.&#160; I found him reading to his sister on the couch today.&#160; He no longer needs incentives.&#160; 
He now reads for his own pleasure.&#160; 


Words can not even begin to describe the joy this brings to me.&#160; Scott and I spent some time in Barnes and Noble last night during our date night.&#160; We love to look around at books at the bookstore.&#160; This time, we also spent considerable time in the Children’s section looking for books for him.&#160; I am beyond excited about the endless possibilities there are for him now that the doors to reading have been opened.&#160; We just learned about [the Magic Tree House series](http://www.magictreehouse.com/) and we bought him book 1 as a surprise.&#160; He is already on chapter 6 tonight!&#160;
