Our oldest son has been a Cub Scout since first grade.  I remember attending his first Blue and Gold banquet that year and watching the Webelos 2 crossing over and thinking, “Wow, those boys look so big.” 

Then I blinked…

And before I knew it my boy was one of the big boys crossing over.

Not sure how that happened so fast.

He was blessed with two amazing den leaders.  They stepped up his first year and stayed with the boys all the way through.  They did so many wonderful activities with the boys and truly sacrificed so much time to provide an AMAZING Cub Scout experience for these guys.  What a gift they have been!

They also helped the boys achieve their Arrow of Light achievement.

We are so proud of our son and look forward to watching him grow as a Boy Scout.
