In the interest of keeping it real, I’m going to tell you that I have not really been much for the whole green fad that has swept my generation.&#160; While we do recycle, that’s about the extent of it.&#160; Then a few years ago my pastor gave a sermon during a series on stewardship that hit home for me.&#160; He talked about the fact that while God did make the world for us to enjoy and inhabit, it didn’t mean he made it for us to squander and trash.&#160; He talked about stewardship in terms of taking care of God’s creation.&#160; I realized that I had been treating this would with a sense of entitlement and with little care to how I effected the environment or creation.&#160; 

![image](http://globalnetcasting.com/media/images/uploads/Green-Mama_rev_2-210x300.jpg)Recently, I read the book [Green Mama…](http://traceybianchi.com/book/) the guilt free Guide to Helping you and your Kids save the planet by Tracey Bianchi.&#160; 

I really like this book b/c it is real and down to earth.&#160; Tracey isn’t preachy and doesn’t make you feel like scum if you aren’t using cloth diapers or organic sheets.&#160; She’s a mom of 3 living in a Chicago suburb who is passionate about taking care of God’s creation and shares that passion in a very practical, applicable way.&#160; 

She comes across as a real mom, one I’d meet on the playground or sit next to at a MOPS meeting.&#160; She does not carry an air of superiority that is so often a real turn off to me.&#160; I like real people.&#160; I don’t like people who portray perfection and make you feel like scum if you don’t do everything the way they do it.

In the beginning of the book Tracey shares her reasons for “going green.”&#160; She gives an analogy of our role in taking care of creation, that I thought was so perfect.&#160; She says:
  > “The weight of saving the world does not rely solely upon us.&#160; God can save the planet himself.&#160; Actually, he already has, which is tough for me to swallow because I like to think God needs me.&#160; Ultimately, God is interested in your heart and movement towards wise living and responsible stewardship, not how many gallons of water you saved this month.&#160;&#160; He created this world and then invited us to partner with him in caring for it.&#160; He wants us involved in the process just like I want my children involved in projects I design for them.&#160; Of course I can make the chocolate-chip cookies myself (and honestly it would be much so much easier that way),” … “We learn magnificent truths about our Creator when we care for God’s creation.&#160; This is what God wants for your family when it comes to taking care of the earth.”  


I thought this was such a beautiful picture of our role as Christians in taking care of creation.&#160; 



At the end of each chapter Tracey encourages you to reflect on one thing you’d like to apply and one you’d like to throw out.&#160; She also encourages you in the book to find one big thing to focus on, rather than trying to change your whole world at once.&#160; I like this because it is practical and doable.&#160;&#160;&#160; Overall, that’s how I’d describe her book.&#160; If you’re like me, and you know you haven’t been living as “green” as you should or like, I think this provides a wonderful introduction.&#160; I also really appreciate the time she spends discussing the motivation for going green.&#160; 



The circus hasn’t completely changed everything… in fact, I am still slowly digesting things.&#160; But, I can feel God tugging on my heart.&#160; I love the beauty of His creation.&#160; I love spending time in it.&#160; I want to be a part of taking care of it and I want to raise my children with attitudes of service rather than entitlement.&#160; 



We live near the Chesapeake Bay.&#160; Each summer our family spends countless hours swimming, fishing, and boating in it.&#160; Sadly, bacteria levels in our bay get so bad that it is monitored weekly and some days we aren’t allowed in it.&#160; I’d like to find some projects that we can work on as a family to help the bay.&#160;&#160; As I teach my kids to enjoy this resource God has given us, I also want to teach them to take care of that resource.



I think I am also going to look into switching to reusable bags.&#160; Tracey said that each year the typical American family uses roughly 1000 plastic bags a year.&#160; 



Tracey has numerous other ideas and information, some of which I am going to try to apply, some of which I will probably “throw out” as she suggests.&#160;&#160;&#160; 



I contacted Tracey and she gave me a copy of the book to read and review for myself.&#160; She in no way compensated me for my review of the book.&#160; These are my thoughts and reactions to her book.&#160; **She also generously gave me 4 copies of the book to give away to my readers!!**&#160; I am so excited to share this with you.&#160; I think you will be challenged, encouraged, and inspired.&#160;
