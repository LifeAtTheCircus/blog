Today we celebrated my oldest son’s 11th birthday.    

How is it that I have been a mom for 11 years now?  I have no idea…. but  today isn’t about me.  It is all about him.

He wanted a nerf gun party.  I was so thankful for picture perfect weather on  party day.  It was a ton of fun to watch them all racing around the yard  shooting each other.

They played several games including target practice, hunger games, duals,  kill the captain and capture the flag.

He is so much fun and I love watching him run the parties.  My role is one of  planning the theme, gathering the supplies prepping the food.  Then I step back  and watch him actually run the show.  And he does it so well.  He is truly in  his element on party days.     

I love the look on his face when the birthday boy ran triumphantly back with  the others teams flag.  Ah, the joy of victory!
