OK, so Halloween was 6 days ago, and I gotta tell you this circus mom has had more than her fair share of the loot.&#160; The kids are doing quite well with an occasional piece after a meal here or there.&#160; Mom on the other hand seems to go for the candy bowl come nap and bed time and she rarely stops with one.&#160; 

The other morning when the kids came out to the living room my son spotted a few candy wrappers sitting on the couch.&#160; (seems someone didn’t dispose of the evidence before falling asleep on the couch at 9pm) He said, “Hey, someone had too much junk food last night!”&#160;&#160;&#160; 

I’m thinking someone needs to gain control before the kids resort to more drastic measures.

Am I alone in this or do I have some fellow candy sneakers out there as well?&#160; Fess up, make a pregnant mom feel better about herself!!
