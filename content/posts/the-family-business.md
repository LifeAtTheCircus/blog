The cool crisp mornings we’ve had lately signal that fall is near.&#160;&#160;&#160; So, this weekend I made good on a summertime promise I made to the kids.&#160; 

We carried out the folding table and chairs…decided on a fair price for our product and made some signs.

While the kids began chanting “25 cent lemonade,”&#160; I quickly stirred some country time and water. 

They eagerly watched for cars and walkers and when they saw them they’d enthusiastically wave and chant.&#160;&#160; (I think they learned well from the vendors at Camden Yards). 

Nana and Pop heard about their business venture and swung by the neighborhood to support the family business.

She quite easily drank as much lemonade as we sold. [![IMG_3001](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_3001.jpg "IMG_3001")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_3001.jpg)

The smiles on their faces made all Momma’s efforts worthwhile.&#160;&#160;

They earned enough to buy 2 packets of silly bands at Target that afternoon.&#160; Though honestly, I think the fun they had selling it was much more valuable.
