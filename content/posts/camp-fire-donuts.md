This recipe for warm and gooey deliciousness is courtesy of Scott’s college room mate.&#160;&#160; It’s not as easy as popping a mallow on a stick and roasting it, but it is oh so worth the effort!&#160; 

You must try camp fire donuts on your next over night camping trip...

First you take a can of Pillsbury breadsticks (or a generic equivalent)

Pop it open

Then you begin to wrap the bread dough around a stick

Next you get some chocolate…chips work best, (but I forgot to put the chips in a cooler so we had to opt for broken bits of Hersey bars b/c my mom put her chocolate in the cooler).&#160;

As you wrap the dough around the stick you add the chocolate and wrap the dough around it.

When you finish make sure you pinch and tuck the top and bottom.

Next you toast the “doughnut” over the fire

till it is golden brown.

You take the golden dough nut and rub it around in butter (ours was melted due to the extreme August heat, but melted just makes it all the better)

Roll the buttered, golden doughnut in brown sugar.

Slide it off the stick

and enjoy!

_I have no idea why they are called doughnuts since they aren’t round and don’t have hole in the center.&#160; But, I do know they are fabulous (and messy (see [Rules of Camping](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/08/17/number-one-rule-of-camping)).&#160; Camp fire doughnuts definitely, [work for me](http://www.wearethatfamily.com)._
