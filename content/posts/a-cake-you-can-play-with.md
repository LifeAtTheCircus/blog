It’s February and that means Blue and Gold banquet season for Cub Scout folks.&#160; An annual tradition at our Blue and Gold banquet is the Dad/Lad cake decorating contest.&#160;

This is always a fun event in the circus household.&#160; Even though all of the baking and decorating is done by Dad and the cub scout… the rest of the kids greatly enjoy observing the fun in the kitchen.

This year they made an entry in the Most Unique category.&#160; They decided to make a “cake you can play with” and therefore, they had to test it out by playing a game of checkers on it.

Another fun part of the Blue and Gold banquet is receiving their awards.&#160; Our son earned his Bear rank tonight…completing his Bob cat trail and filling in the last of his diamonds on his uniform.&#160;

They were delightfully surprised when they were awarded first place in their cake category!
