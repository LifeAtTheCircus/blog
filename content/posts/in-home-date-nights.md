With three children under 4, it isn't always easy to get out for a date night.  Sometimes we do date nights at home.  We feed the kids a simple dinner... chicken nuggets or hot dogs.  While I am getting the kids ready for bed, my husband grills us steak for dinner.   We light a candle and enjoy a leisurely dinner together.  We get to talk, uninterrupted and enjoy our food while it is still warm.  I have found that steaks typically go on sale at least once a month.  We can do the entire steak dinner for two with under $15 which is way cheaper then anything but fast food out on the town.  While we still enjoy going out for an occasional date night, our home date nights allow us to have a special evening together more often.

Sometimes we want to top the evening off with a movie, so we'll head to our local [Red Box](http://www.redbox.com/).  If you haven't tried Red Box yet, I highly recommend it.  It is basically a movie vending machine, most often they are in front of McDonald's (I have seen some area grocery stores with them as well).  For one dollar,  you can rent a New Release movie. To find your nearest Red Box, visit their website.  You can even find out what movies are in stock and available.   You have until 9pm the next night to return it to _any Red Box_.  This typically isn't a problem for us, but if you're late, they just charge you another dollar for an additional night.  You'd have to keep it for 4 nights to equal the cost of renting it at Blockbuster.   And there are no membership fees either.

Time alone with my hubby without breaking the bank....that works for me, to find out what works of others check out [Rocks in My Dryer](http://www.rocksinmydryer.typepad.com).
