[![IMG_6659](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-6659-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-6659.jpg) A few weeks ago I was given a voucher for a free gallon of milk from a certain grocery store.  Today I finally made it back to the store but when I went to pull the voucher from my purse, I had a bit of trouble finding it.  When I got home I decided it was time to clean out my purse.

I really could put Mary Poppins to the test for who has more in her lovely bag.

Check out what I discovered today. 

*   1 sharpie (besides the bottle of ibuprofin this is possibly the most dangerous thing in here)

And at last my free milk voucher...which expired on August 5th.

While I may not have had a coat rack in there, I could take comfort in the fact that if I was stranded in a snow storm I could start a fire with my car lighter, 15 receipts, and 27 coupons!!

Of course, not anymore..

Now that [I've tackled it](http://www.5minutesformom.com/4014/tt-116/), I'd say it would be much better to rely on her bag of tricks instead![![image](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/image-thumb3.png)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/image4.png)
