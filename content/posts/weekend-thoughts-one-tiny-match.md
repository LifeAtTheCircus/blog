Have you ever experienced complete darkness?&#160; I’m not talking about shutting out the lights before you crawl under the covers, but total darkness.&#160; In our electronic world of LEDs, it’s something we don’t often experience.&#160; 

During [our time exploring Carlsbad](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/08/25/pictures-cant-do-the-day-justice/) earlier this week, the ranger brought us into a cavern 830 feet below the earth and shut off the lights.&#160; No flash lights.&#160;&#160; No matches.&#160; No floor lights. Nothing.

It was dark.

As in, total darkness.

As in, so dark I literally held my hand in front of my face and saw nothing.

Then she lit a match and suddenly that one match lit up the entire cavern. 

It’s amazing how much light one match can put off.&#160; Honestly, I don’t know which struck me more, the black of darkness or the amount of light cast by that one match.

I got to thinking about this world.&#160; We know it’s a dark place.&#160; The Bible talks of it often.&#160; And sometimes in this day and age, you really feel it, don’t you?&#160;&#160; Sometimes you turn on the TV, or enter your place of work, or walk out in your street and it seems you can see the darkness everywhere.&#160; You wonder where the other Christians are.&#160; Why does it feel so evil and cold?&#160; 

Jesus tells us in Matthew 5:14-16 “_You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
&#160; 
Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
&#160; 
In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.”_

You might feel alone in this dark world.&#160; But when you live for Christ, when you let his light shine in your life, _you are the light of the world_.&#160; And one light, one small little match, can light an entirely dark cavern.&#160; One light can make a difference.&#160; 

So, I encourage you to let your light shine around you.&#160; You don’t need to wait until you have an entire candelabra to light the room.&#160; One tiny little match can make a difference.&#160;&#160; 1 John 5-7, “_God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all
 
sin.”&#160;_
