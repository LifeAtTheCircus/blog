Since the day he was born, people have been telling me that my son looks like his Daddy.&#160; He's been referred to as Scott 2.0 and Mini-Me.&#160;&#160; I don't argue that there is no debating who his Daddy is, but I will say that he's got my eyes.

Make that eye.

For photography.

Check out these pictures I took of my parents when I was in elementary school.&#160;&#160;

First we have my mom showing off her Christmas ear rings... at least I THINK that is my mom... it looks like her hands but I managed to cut off the top of her head.&#160;&#160; Then we have my Dad showing us what I assume is his birthday gift, can't see it though.&#160; I did get a great shot of our wall though with my smiling Dad off to the side.&#160; Apparently when gifts were given, I got the privilege of holding the camera.&#160; Big Mistake.&#160; Clearly I struggled with framing the subject.

Now here is a photo my son took of his Mommy and Daddy at Christmas when he was 2 1/2.&#160; See the resemblance?&#160;

Yep, clearly he has his mothers eye.

Daddy takes way better pictures.&#160; Like the ones he took [here](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/20/weekend-thoughts-enjoying-his-creation/) at the zoo, framed beautifully, heads all in tack.

I think my son might be a protegy though... at 2 and 1/2 he was taking pictures on par with my photography at age 9 or 10...wait, maybe that means he _is_ like his father!!
