It’s always fun to peek in on my kiddos when they are sleeping.&#160; Sometimes because it gives me a good chuckle, sometimes because it tugs at my heart strings, and sometimes just because it sets my mind at ease to see them sleeping snuggly in their rooms.&#160; 

Last night as I was crawling into bed, I realized I hadn’t peeked in on them.&#160; I don’t know if I’m the only Mom out there like this, but when I realize I forgot, I just can’t shake it off… I have to go b/c sometimes this little quirky fear will rise up “What if the one night I didn’t check on them something was wrong?” 

Which is why it was all the more comical, that when I opened the boys room, the first thing I saw was this.

“Oh my,” I thought.&#160; And I confess for a split second, as my eyes scanned the room, looking for my baby boy, I had a little fear in my gut that something was not right. 

And then, I saw this….

(_yup, he’s wearing his big sisters bright pink Dora socks… No, she didn’t do this to him, he did it to himself…)_&#160; Stifling a giggle, I ran to grab the camera… So, glad I didn’t skip my night time peek, I’d have hated to miss this precious sight.
