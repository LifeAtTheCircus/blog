Ya know that feeling you get when you look at your kids and you just wanna freeze time?&#160; You don’t want them to grow up, not one bit, so you just try your best to hold on to the moments while you can.

Well, we figured out a way to freeze time here at the circus…just a little…

Our littlest crew member turned one earlier this month.&#160; Not sure how that year flew by so fast.&#160;&#160;

However, we didn’t celebrate his birthday until this past weekend.&#160; So, in a way… we froze time for a little longer.&#160;

But, now that his scrapbook and video are both finished (circus family 1st birthday traditions), and he’s had that first bite of cake, there really is no denying it…

The Circus Baby is one.&#160;
