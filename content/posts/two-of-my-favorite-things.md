**Updated with new picture from today below**


Today I get to celebrate two of my favorite things... 

[Chick-Fil-A](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/15/what-ill-do-to-my-children-for-free-chick-fil-a/) and [Football](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/19/star-struck/).  :-)

Today, Chick-Fil-A is giving away their new chicken strips (which, by the way, are delicious, and my hubby and my new fav menu item) to anyone who visits their store wearing a football logo.  Check it out [here](http://www.cheerforchicken.com/) for more details.  

You better believe that all 5 of us will be sporting our Steelers pride at Chick-Fil-A today when we stop for lunch on our way back from our [annual Labor Day](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/27/the-lucky-ones/) get together.

**Any other Chick-Fil-A lovin' football fans out there??**
