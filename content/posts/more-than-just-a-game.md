Last night I came home from Kids Quest (our church’s evening class for kids in which we teach them the questions from the Shorter Catechism), pizza in hand and Scott and I quickly tag teamed to get the kids in bed so we could hit play and watch the recorded Steelers game.&#160; (I seriously think the invention of the DVR has got to go on my top 5 list of inventions that changed my life… I LOVE it)!&#160;&#160;&#160; Pizza, coke, beer, terrible towels… we were set for one of favorite kind of date nights… Steelers Football. 

And for awhile the date was going well.&#160; We were ahead, the defense was holding them, life was good.&#160; I started to relax.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

And then came the fourth quarter in which no relaxing took place as my stomach was in knots and I watched Limas Sweed drop a beautiful catch in the end zone.&#160; And Jeff Reed miss a field goal (2 weeks in a row now) and our defense let the Bengals pound us down and score a game winning touch down in the last 14 seconds of the game.&#160; 

And just like that my date night was ruined.&#160; 

We sat in silence.&#160; 

One thing I love about my relationship with Scott is how well we know and get each other.&#160; 

And we both know that after the Steelers lose, there must, must be a moment of silence.&#160; There is no small talk to be had.&#160; No, “Oh well, let’s try again next week.”&#160; No.&#160; None of that.&#160; 

Neither of us want to talk about it or anything for awhile.&#160; 

So, what is there to do, but check my fantasy team.&#160; I’ve had a rough start this year in fantasy football.&#160; Last year I started great and actually made it to the play off round.&#160; I was second place over all.&#160;&#160; I say that to boost my ego, b/c this year I am 0-3.&#160; And I don’t understand it.&#160; I have a good team.&#160; I had the 1 and 3 highest ranking wide receivers starting yesterday.&#160; And they gave me a total of 14 points.&#160; Not enough, I tell ya, not enough. 

I opened live writer to write a post, but didn’t feel it.&#160; Sure, I could have posted a pic of my kids at the library on Saturday with a real replica of R2D2 and Darth Vador and a host of other Star Wards bad guys…. but the force just wasn’t with me.&#160; I could have shared pics and anecdotes from our semi spontaneous apple orchard trip on Friday afternoon, but it seemed too… chipper. 

So, discouraged, I went to bed. 

And that my dear readers is why it is now 3:00 on Monday and I am just now able to get a post up.
