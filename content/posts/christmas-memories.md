We have had a wonderful couple of days here at the circus celebrating Jesus’ birthday.&#160; We decided to spread the celebrating out over several days rather than cram it all into one day.&#160; On Christmas Eve we went to the Children’s service at our church at 4:30.&#160; Then we went to Boston Market for our now traditional Christmas Eve dinner before heading back to church for the candlelight service at 6:30.&#160; We then went home to change into our Christmas pj’s, read Luke 2, put up our advent calendar piece, and leave cookies and milk for Santa.&#160; Christmas morning we had both sets of grandparents here, Great Grandpa, Aunt Karen and baby Eli.&#160; The kids were up a little after 7 and the revelry began shortly after.&#160; We took our time opening presents and enjoying our time together.&#160; We then had a pot luck brunch followed by more playtime.&#160; On the 26th the gang all came back for a more formal Christmas dinner followed by birthday cake and ice cream for baby Jesus and some game playing with Aunt Karen’s Wii. I really appreciated getting to spread the celebration out over several days rather than try to rush it and cram it all in on one day.&#160; I am also so thankful for our extended family.&#160; It’s now Sunday night and I am looking forward to having Scott home for the entire week.&#160; We hope to enjoy some great family time as well as tackle some projects around the house.&#160; 

Hope you all had a wonderful and merry Christmas!
