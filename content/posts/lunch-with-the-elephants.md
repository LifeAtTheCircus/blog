Every year when the circus comes to Baltimore, they do a special lunch with the elephants at the nearby Lexington Market.&#160;&#160;&#160; It’s a Baltimore tradition.&#160; And according to what I’ve read, Baltimore is the only city that hosts such an event annually.&#160; _When I told the kids this, they said, “Well, at least Baltimore has one good thing about it.”&#160; Hahaha… these kids may have been born and raised in Maryland, but their blood runs black and gold….&#160;_ 

I have been wanting to go for years, but it hasn’t yet worked out with our schedule.&#160;&#160; It’s in the middle of the day in the middle of a work/school week and it isn’t super easy to find out the day and time.&#160; 

This year we were able to go.&#160; I was so excited!&#160; I packed us a lunch so we wouldn’t have to spend any money other than parking.&#160; We picked Scott up from work and drove to Baltimore.&#160; We got there in plenty of time to secure a spot and wait for the elephants to march in.&#160; While we waited, we got to be entertained by some Chick-Fil-A cows and some circus clowns.&#160; The three year old particularly enjoyed these acts.

At noon, the elephants march right down the streets of Baltimore to a parking lot outside Lexington Market where they get to feast on 1100 oranges, 1000 apples, 500 heads of lettuce, 700 bananas, 400 pears and 500 carrots.&#160; After that ginormous buffet, they gave the elephants watermelon.&#160; It was really neat to watch them stomp on the watermelon to break them open and then use their trunks to load them into their mouths.
