I had a dream last night that I went to the movies and when it was my turn to order the tickets, I couldn’t remember the name of the movie we wanted to see.&#160; For some reason they didn’t list them on the wall behind the register like normal.&#160; I tried to call someone for help, but suddenly my phone had been replaced with a different phone and every time I hit the buttons for my contact list, it took me to some funky screen and I couldn’t find anyone’s number.&#160; As the line behind me grew and grew I kept begging the man at the register, “Please, it’s about a guy and a girl… it’s a comedy, with a little romance…you know the one…what is it?”&#160; 

The funny thing is at the end of the dream when I finally found out the name of the movie, I said to myself, “Man, my memory is really going…it must be [momnesia](http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-03-03-momnesia_N.htm)…I have totally gotta blog about this.” 

And then I woke up.

What?&#160; I am blogging in my dreams now?&#160; I thought it was bad enough that when my kids say something funny and I laugh, that they ask if I am going to blog about it.&#160; Or the fact that when I go to share a funny anecdote with a friend, I am often interrupted with the phrase, “yea I know I read about that on your blog”&#160; But blogging in my dreams?&#160; I think I may need some serious help.&#160;
