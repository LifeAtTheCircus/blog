At our house, the rule is No Christmas anything until after Thanksgiving.  My hubby is pretty strict about this...He even scolded my grandma on Thanksgiving for wearing a Christmas sweater.  

But, come the day after Thanksgiving you better believe we are cranking those yuletide carols as loud as we can as we head out for some good ol' fashioned Black Friday Shopping!

I LOVE CHRISTMAS!!  It is by far my most favorite holiday of all.  

To kick off the holiday season, I thought I'd post my answers to  a "Getting To Know You Christmas Edition" e-mail I received from two different friends last week.    So, for those of you interested in learning a little more about Christmas Circus style, grab some hot cocoa and read below.
