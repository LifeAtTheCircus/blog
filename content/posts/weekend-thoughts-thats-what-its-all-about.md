### I am reposting this post from last year because, it’s still what it’s all about and I love reminding myself of that as often as possible.&#160; 

### That’s What It’s All About…


December 20, 2008


in [Weekend Thoughts](http://lifeatthecircus.com/category/weekend-thoughts/)

As we were getting ready to go to the [tree lighting ceremony](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/05/my-how-12-years-has-changed-things-a-bit/) downtown my son asked, _“Mom, can I tell Santa that he is **not** what Christmas is all about?”_

I love that as we anticipate Christmas, my kids know that we are preparing to celebrate Jesus’ birth.&#160; Yes, they know we are going to have presents under the tree, and they even sat on Santa’s lap at Scott’s work party, but when I asked my son what he likes best about Christmas, he answered, “celebrating Jesus’ birthday.”&#160; This warms my heart, because the lights, the tree, the songs, the cookies, the presents, the pageants…all of them are meaningless traditions without Christ.&#160; 
 









  

&#160;

But it’s about much more than just the Christ child being born in the stable.&#160; Because without the cross that too would be meaningless.&#160; If you’ll bear with me, I have yet another video clip to share.&#160; I’ll put the lyrics below so you can read them as well.&#160; This song was on the [Go Fish](http://www.gofishguys.com/cms/pages/the-music/snow.php) Christmas CD I bought for my kids this year and it’s become one of my new favorites.&#160; With 5 days left till Christmas, as we scurry around to finish shopping, cleaning, cards, baking and fitting in all of the traditions, let us not forget to take time to reflect on what it is really all about.
 









  

&#160;

It’s not just about the manger      
Where the baby lay       
It’s not all about the angels       
Who sang for him that day       
It’s not just about the shepherds       
Or the bright and shining star       
It’s not all about the wisemen       
Who travelled from afar       
Chorus:       
It’s about the cross       
It’s about my sin       
It’s about how Jesus came to be born once       
So that we could be born again       
It’s about the stone       
That was rolled away       
So that you and I could have real life someday       
It’s about the cross       
It’s about the cross       
Verse 2:       
It’s not just about the presents       
Underneath the tree       
It’s not all about the feeling       
That the season brings to me       
It’s not just about coming home       
To be with those you love       
It’s not all about the beauty       
In the snow I’m dreaming of       
Repeat Chorus       
Bridge:       
The beginning of the story is wonderful and great       
But it’s the ending that can save you and that’s why we celebrate       
It’s about the cross       
It’s about my sin       
It’s about how Jesus came to be born once       
So that we could be born again       
It’s about God’s love       
Nailed to a tree       
It’s about every drop of blood that flowed from Him when it should have been me       
It’s about the stone       
That was rolled away       
So that you and I could have real life someday       
So that you and I could have real life someday       
It’s about the cross       
It’s about the cross
