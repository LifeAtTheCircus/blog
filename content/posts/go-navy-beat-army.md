My father in law graduated from the Naval Academy, so I became a Navy fan by marriage.  And the biggest game of the year for them is the Army/Navy game.

Knowing this, you might better appreciate the conversation I had with my son yesterday...

 
 > Mom:  Tomorrow is the Army/Navy football game
> 
> Son:  Army doesn't play football, they fight bad guys
> 
> Hmmm see he's seen Navy football games with his Dad and Pop, and all he knows about the Army is that his Uncle Jim and our cousin Joel are in the Army and they fight bad guys...better clear up this misconception before he goes around saying Navy plays football and Army fights bad guys...
> 
> Mom: Well, these are Army guys that are in college learning how to fight bad guys and they play football too. 

GO NAVY....BEAT ARMY!!!
