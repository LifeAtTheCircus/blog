[Every now and then](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/10/06/not-much-has-changed/), when I peek in on my oldest daughter before going to sleep, I’ll see something which instantly takes me back to her infancy.

And even though she’ll be 6 in a few short weeks, I see her as this sweet little 8 month old in her crib, sleeping folded in half.&#160;

I’ll remember how she used to sleep like this every.single night… and suddenly all these pictures of her sleeping like this pass through my mind like a slide show.&#160;

Pack-n-play, hospital hooked up to IVs, crib, toddler bed, bottom bunk, top bunk… she’s done it ever where.&#160; It’s her classic sleeping position.&#160; And it makes me smile every.single.time.&#160; Sweet dreams my little girl!
