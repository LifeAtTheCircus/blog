Saturday we ventured out for White Sands, NM.&#160; We had high hopes for some sand sledding.&#160; 

I was expecting it to be like this.

Only there is this phenomenon in Texas we recently discovered called Wind Season.&#160; Who knew?&#160; (Yes, knowledge of this would have been helpful in planning our vacation).&#160; 

So when we arrived at White Sands we discovered something called a sand storm.

And unlike a snow storm, sand storms hurt.&#160; Amazing how wind gusts pelting sand onto your face doesn’t exactly feel good.&#160; I had envisioned the kids loving life as they went sledding in nice 70 degree weather.&#160; But, they weren’t big fans of the sand blasting.

So instead of doing this,

the kids rode in the car for 2 hours to do this

while Mom and Dad did this

Thankfully though we went with our close family friends and aunt and uncle.&#160; So for the 4 hours of driving to nowhere, they got to enjoy time with their new friend.&#160; And I gotta say, the kids were great.&#160; They sang songs and played phone and make believe.&#160; It was a huge blessing.&#160;

And even though it wasn’t exactly like I thought it would be, I am glad we went.&#160; Because I have never seen sand like this and it gave me an appreciation of what it would be like to walk in the desert.&#160;
