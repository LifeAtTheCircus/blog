I went in to wake my daughter from nap time today and found her like this.

I’m not sure if she fell asleep while playing or if she was just doing all she could to keep herself from falling asleep.&#160; 

Either way, looks rather uncomfortable to me. 

Then there’s her sister.

We looked down during a soccer game a few weeks ago and found her like this.[![IMG_7007](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_7007.jpg "IMG_7007")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_7007.jpg) 

 Yes, that would be my youngest asleep **ON** the soccer field, **during** a game.

And, yes, I took a picture of her sleeping on the field, _before_ I removed her. 

Seems, if they are tired enough, my girls will sleep in the most unusual positions.&#160;
