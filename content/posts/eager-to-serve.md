The other day my son told me he wanted to make all of us breakfast the next morning.&#160; 

The only problem with this very sweet gesture was that it was the end of the month and we were at the “creative” stage of the month/meal plan. 

Bread?&#160; No

Milk?&#160; No

Cereal? No

Not much available for a 5 yr old to fix, so I convinced him to wait till after I went grocery shopping on Monday.&#160; 

Tuesday morning we woke, and stayed in bed per his request (didn’t really take much convincing since we aren’t exactly early risers).&#160; 

A little after 7 we saw him race down the hallway (like a child on Christmas morning).&#160; 

I had poured milk and orange juice into glasses the night before (per his request) so that he could do it himself.&#160;&#160; He ran to the bedroom once to have me open the jelly (without looking).&#160; And then when he was almost ready, we peeked around the corner and saw this.

“toast for Daddy”

don’t forget the cereal Dad. (brimming with milk)

He made Mommy chocolate Ovaltine

He even made both girls their breakfast as well.

When I asked him what prompted this gesture of love, he told me that they talked the other day at his tutorial about how if your mom was sick, you could help her out by making breakfast for her.&#160; He said, “I thought, why wait till your sick to do it!”

Scott had a meeting he had to rush to get to at work, and we had schoolwork to get done before a well check up at the pediatrician’s office and our field trip that afternoon.&#160; 

But we sat and waited while he jellied our toast, poured our cereal, and stirred our milk.&#160; [![IMG_6312](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6312.jpg "IMG_6312")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6312.jpg) 

And as I watched him serve with joy and excitement, I was reminded of the privilege it is to serve one’s family.&#160; 

May we always find it a joy to serve.
