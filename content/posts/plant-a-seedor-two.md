I am so excited to share some news with you all. After my post [on Friday](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/02/27/they-are-always-listening/) about how much I loved the Seeds Family worship CDs, Michelle from Seeds contacted me.  She’s offering all of my readers a 20% discount off of any of their CD’s.  I have my very first discount code!  How cool is that?!  

Simply enter the code **CIRCUSREADERS09** when purchasing a CD from [their site](http://www.seedsmusicstore.com ).  I plan to buy some more myself!
