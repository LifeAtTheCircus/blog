The other day after quiet time my oldest emerged from his room with his first book.&#160; I knew nothing of his project until he emerged but was blown away by what he produced.&#160; On the cover page his listed himself as the “osr” and “iliusha” (author and illustrator).&#160;&#160; For his first book, he pretty much spells out the gospel message in word and pictures. 

Page One:&#160; “God loved us”&#160; (I must say the spelling on this one def made me chuckle).

Page Two: God made the stars.&#160; God made the moon, God made the sun. God made the flowers.

Page 3: Jesus Loves You.&#160;

Page 4:&#160; has the tomb with the stone in front, and then Jesus outside of the tomb (notice the marks on his hands?) and the angel in front of the empty tomb.

&#160;

Last page:&#160; The End.&#160; (notice the bar code at the bottom?)

When he showed it to us, my husband immediately said he wanted to scan it into the computer.&#160; When my son heard this he said, “Oh, if you want to scan it then hold on…and he went and drew the “bar code” on the back.

I have many pictures and cards he’s made over the past years, but this is def one of my most treasured.&#160; I love that he spelled it all on his own, I love the pictures he drew, but most importantly, I love the story he chose to tell.
