When my son asked if he could bring his light sabers or guns to his sisters first soccer practice, I said no.&#160;&#160; Because sometimes it is awkward to deal with the whole gun issue out in public.

Obviously I forgot that little boys will turn absolutely anything into a gun.[![IMG_0635](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0612.jpg "IMG_0635")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0612.jpg)

So today I said what the heck, bring the gun.&#160;&#160; 

Which apparently translated to, go crazy, carry a gun in each hand and a concealed weapon… Heck, why not wear the entire uniform!

So much for flying under the radar… that is something the circus fam just doesn’t know how to do.
