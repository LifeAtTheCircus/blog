&#160; Our third born has literally been on the fast track since birth.&#160; I swear she was born holding her head up and eagerly chasing after her older 2 siblings, not wanting to be left out for even a second.&#160; She was clearly not meant to be the “baby” of the family.

Most of the time when my kids celebrate a birthday, I find myself reflecting on how quickly time passes and marveling at how could they be so old so fast.&#160; 

Not so with her.

Scott and I joke that maybe we got her birth date wrong b/c it just feels like she’s been three for months already.&#160;&#160; Finally the big day arrived.&#160; And what better way to celebrate then by having her friends and family join her at the park for a picnic and swimming on the hottest day of the year.&#160;&#160; We had a heat index of 110!&#160; But it didn’t spoil her fun in the least!
