[![IMG_5706](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/img-5706-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/img-5706.jpg) I had a great post written &quot;in my head&quot; Saturday morning.&#160; I was setting off to do a 6 mile run.&#160; It would have been the longest run I had ever done in my life.&#160; Before training for the Annapolis 10 Mile that [I am working towards](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/13/summer-running/) at the end of the summer, the farthest I had run was a 5K (3.1 miles)&#160; So, this would have been about twice that.&#160; 

Ya know how they say don't count your chickens before they hatch?

Yea...don't write your blog achievements before you actually do them.

I learned a few more things on my run Saturday morning.

*   The later in the day you run, the hotter it is and thus the harder it is to run.&#160; Sleeping in on Saturday was SO not worth it once I was running in the sun.
*   Starting on a hill is the way to go.&#160; I clearly do not know how to pace myself.&#160; At home I start going up hill which really helps.&#160; This time I started down hill and then flat...I burned out fast.
*   When given the choice of running beside the water or under the shade of a building, I go with the shade.&#160; Views are nice but when you are hot and tired, you'll slow down for every tree you find.
*   There is no stopping to get a rest for a minute... this is a deadly trap.

Yea, I tried that and I am sad to tell you I didn't finish my run.&#160; I was tired, and I gave up.&#160; And the long walk back to my family waiting at the playground stunk.

I have never considered myself to be a competitive person.&#160; I played lacrosse in high school (by play I mean I wore the uniform while sitting on the bench).&#160; I didn't really care if we won or loss, I was just there to have fun with my friends.&#160; 

But walking back from my run, I felt like crying.&#160; I had a goal.&#160; I wanted to run 6 miles that day and instead I ran less than what I had done in the past.&#160; I couldn't blame it on anyone.&#160; I had no excuse.&#160; I stopped.&#160; I didn't meet my goal.&#160; I felt like for the first time I could relate to a receiver who was wide open but let the ball slip through his fingers, or the basketball player who missed the free throw shot...no one to blame but yourself.&#160; 

By the time I met up with my crew, I had a new resolve.&#160; I would try again Monday.&#160; I would _not give up_.&#160;&#160; I have 4 weeks to prepare to run 10 miles.&#160; Currently I know I can run 4 without a problem.&#160; 6 to go... Had I not set this [goal](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/22/my-need-for-goals/) for myself, I am confident at this point I'd give up.&#160; I do not see that as an option since I have registered, blogged about it, and signed up with friends and family to run with me.&#160; 

So today I will try again.&#160; I can only hope that the thrill of victory will be all the sweeter after tasting the agony of defeat this weekend.&#160; 

But I won't write that post yet...
