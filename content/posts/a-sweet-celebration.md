We celebrated my Dad’s 60th Birthday this week with a party at Hershey park.&#160; Dad, Mom, their kids, and their 8 grandkids.&#160;

We had a blast riding the rides, but truly the best part was being together as a family and enjoying watching relationships grow.&#160;

When you’re the oldest cousin sometimes you have to do time in the kiddy rides.&#160; He was quite the sport… and was rewarded with roller coaster time in the evening.

My mom prepared tons of food for lunch and dinner.&#160; We tailgated in the parking lot for lunch before we went into the park and again in the evening with cupcakes and party horns.

My youngest niece is def a future thrill seeker.&#160; She had her hands in the air before the ride even took off. [![IMG_0841](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_0841.jpg "IMG_0841")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_0841.jpg)
