My lil guy isn’t a newborn anymore.&#160; I’ve known it for awhile.. he’s [eating solids](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/11/23/savoring-each-bite/), [vocalizing](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2011/01/21/banner-day-at-the-circus/), and working on crawling.&#160; But, recently, I also realized his days of simply sleeping in my arms are fleeting.&#160; He’s working himself into a rhythm… sleeping through the night… taking 2 solid naps a day…The days of just holding [my tiny, sleeping newborn](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/06/08/discharge-instructions/) in my arms are over.&#160; 

So on those random Sunday afternoons when he falls asleep in my arms, I am going to stay put and savor the moment.&#160; I’m not going to lay him down, no so much out of fear of waking him, but out of fear of missing the all too fleeting moment.&#160;

**“Dusting and scrubbing can wait 'till tomorrow        
For babies grow fast we learn to our sorrow.         
So quiet down cobwebs and dust go to sleep         
I'm rocking my baby and babies don't keep.”**
