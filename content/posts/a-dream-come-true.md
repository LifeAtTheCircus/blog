Two months ago, my mom came across some of my old school papers and she passed this one along to me.  I wrote it in first grade.   I have no recollection of writing this, but I have to think that God smiled as I wrote it, thinking, "You have no idea Crystal that your dream will come true exactly as you wish for."  Today I thank God for allowing me to be the mom to 3 wonderful children, one son and two daughters.

Is that cool or what?  I really am living my dream!
