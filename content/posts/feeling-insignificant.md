Last week after telling my kids the Bible story of&#160; baby Moses, I decided to offer a little application for them.&#160; I pointed out how neat it was that God took care of Moses as a baby by allowing the princess to find him.&#160; I even told how amazing it was that his own mother was allowed to take care of him before he went to live at the palace.&#160; After discussing how Moses grew up in the Egyptian palace, I pointed out how God used that later in his life when Moses led the Israelites out of captivity in Egypt.&#160;&#160; I was going on about how we don’t understand the plans God has for our lives, but he has special plans for each of our lives, and just like God had a plan for Moses, he has a plan for each of them.&#160; 

Of course my son had to be argumentative_
 (is 7 the new 13 or is this just at the circus?)
_&#160; and say he didn’t think there was anything special about his life.&#160;&#160; Which I then refuted, telling them that long before they were even in my belly, God had planned out their entire life and he did indeed have a special plan for each of them.&#160; 

My son, then replies, “Well, what about you Mom?&#160; God didn’t do anything special with your life.”

_Seriously folks, motherhood is not for the faint of heart… ya gotta be thick skinned to survive this stuff._ 

I refuted with the fact that I thought my life was pretty special… look I get to raise and take care of 4 special kids _(sweet, loving kids who think the world of their mother… ahem)_ &#160;&#160; and FURTHERMORE… I pointed out… my life is not over… who knows what other things God has planned for me or through me… _thankyouverymuch!_

But, apparently, you gotta lead God’s people out of captivity and into the promised land in order to be considered special around here.&#160;
