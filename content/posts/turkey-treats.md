We’re taking the week off…no tutorial, no home school.&#160; 

V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N! TIME!

Today we made turkey cookies thanks to [this post](http://themcmommychronicles.blogspot.com/2009/11/attack-of-optimist.html) I read last night.&#160; Rule number 1, don’t look to close at the [example picture here](http://www.pillsbury.com/Recipes/ShowRecipe.aspx?rid=40040), just quickly look at it to get the idea, then close it.&#160; Otherwise, these won’t seem exactly up to snuff.&#160; But, we had a blast&#160; decorating them and they taste yummy, so who cares if they aren’t picture perfect?&#160; And really, when is the circus family picture perfect?&#160;&#160; It was, none the less,&#160; a great way to start Thanksgiving week.&#160;&#160; Thanks [McMommy](http://themcmommychronicles.blogspot.com)![![IMG_3501](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3501.jpg "IMG_3501")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3501.jpg)Tomorrow I hope to make [these popcorn balls](http://bobbicamacho.blogspot.com/2009/11/popcorn-balls.html) to bring to my parents house.&#160; My dad loves popcorn balls, so when I read [this post](http://bobbicamacho.blogspot.com/2009/11/popcorn-balls.html), I was eager to try them.&#160; I am hoping they aren’t too tricky as we have Bible Study in the morning, a quick trip to the grocery store to make and then popcorn balls and pepperoni bread to make before Scott gets home from work and we hit the road.&#160; Thankfully our suitcases are packed.&#160; Worse case scenario, I bring the ingredients to Mom and Dad’s and make them on Wednesday.
