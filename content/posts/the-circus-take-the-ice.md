I wasn’t aiming for some idealist, Kodak winter moment.&#160;&#160; Just an evening of winter fun with the kids.&#160; With the baby dropped off at my in laws, Scott and I set out for an evening on the ice with the big 3.&#160;&#160; Scott had his reservations and voiced them a few times.&#160; But, I was confident we’d be fine.&#160; [![IMG_7685](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_7685.jpg "IMG_7685")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_7685.jpg)

Once we were all laced up and approaching the rink, my confidence began [![IMG_7691](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_7691.jpg "IMG_7691")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_7691.jpg)to waver.&#160; Seems when I signed us up for this evening of family fun, I forgot that I have only been ice skating 3 times in my 31 years.&#160; And the last time I went on the ice was well over 10 yrs ago.&#160; As we quickly grabbed scooters for the kids to hold onto, I found myself wishing they had one in my size!

Everyone else seemed to be flying past me with confidence.&#160; Meanwhile I stuck to my 3 yr old like glue, “helping” her steer her scooter in the small patch of scuffed up ice that the Zamboni missed.&#160;&#160; 

10 minutes into the first hour and I was ready for a break.&#160;&#160; Scott took to the ice with no problem and immediately took turns taking one kid around the rink while I stayed in the safe patch with the other 2, doing my very best not to panic and to stay standing up.

When my youngest said she wanted to sit out, I leapt at the chance to take her to the side.&#160; Of course the moment we get off the rink, she starts begging to go back out.&#160; Thankfully, intermission was called shortly and we all took a break to watch the Zamboni clean the ice.&#160; 

There it was, all slick and shiny again.&#160; 

I suggested we led the mob go out first and we could then trickle out a few minutes later.

I gotta tell you, the second hour on the ice went MUCH better.&#160; I even left my “safe zone” and took a spin or two around the rink singing songs with my 3 year old.&#160;&#160;&#160; I think all of us had gotten the hang of it a little better and were able to skate with a more confidence.&#160; [![IMG_7693](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_7693.jpg "IMG_7693")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_7693.jpg)

When Scott lifted my 3 year old and carried her for a lap around the rink, she giggled and told him this was the “high” of her day.

We left before our 2 hrs were up, but we left while everyone was still happy and smiling.&#160;&#160;&#160; As we walked back to the car my 3 yr old asked, “Mom why is skating so cold and slippery?”&#160;&#160;&#160; While I definitely had my moments of doubt, over all the evening was a success and I am glad we went, even if it did stretch me out of my comfort zone a bit!
