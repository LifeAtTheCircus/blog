[![IMG_0592](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_0592.jpg "IMG_0592")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_0592.jpg)We rung out 2011 with a date day in DC for Scott and I on the 30th and then a good ol’ family fun day on the 31st. 
 (more pics and details on those to come in a later blog post). 
 As we spent time reflecting on 2011, Scott and I both found ourselves commenting on how grateful we are for our life.&#160;&#160; We don’t deserve this life of comfort and good fortune.&#160; And we def aren’t doing everything right with what we have.&#160; But, one thing I know for sure, we are so, very very thankful for this life we have… with each other and our children.&#160; 

And so as we enter a new year, brimming with possibilities, goals, hopes and plans… I must first pause… and give thanks for the memories and moments of 2011.&#160; 

In 2011, we….

lost our first tooth:

My awesome SIL Karen treated me to a real hair cut at a salon… so this stay at home momma upgraded her “take a few inches off in the kitchen once every 3 yr haircut”&#160; to an actual style!&#160;

We played lots and celebrated much this year.

We also said goodbye to a Grandpa/Great Grandpa whom we all love and miss very much.&#160; 

[![IMG_7214](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_7214.jpg "IMG_7214")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_7214.jpg)

His passing gives us pause to remember that while activities and events may fill our days, life comes with a purpose that surpasses all those things. It is the way God is glorified in the mist of activities that shape the legacy we leave.&#160; And with that in mind, we pray, as we venture into 2012, that God grant us the wisdom to pursue each day in a way that glorifies Him.

 Happy New Year!!
