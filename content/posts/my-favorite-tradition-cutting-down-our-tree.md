The hunt begins…

Gloves?

Check.

Tree cart?

Check.

Now to find the perfect tree.

“How about this one I suggest?”

“No, that looks like an angel tree,” my son says.&#160; “We need to find a star tree.”

My son doesn’t like when there are too many branches on the bottom as they are harder to cut down.&#160; (We always pick spruces and they are quite painful and prickly).

But, I’m not convinced about the one with a dead spot on the bottom…even if it is easier to cut down.

And then we find it… 

This years tree

Many hands make light work (or so they say)

Upon cutting it down, my youngest exclaims, “Now let’s cut down another one!”

As I watched my son struggle to put the tree on the cart, I realized how big he’s getting and how it won’t be long till he really can do it by himself.

And we head home, as the sun sets, ready to commence another advent season.
