Last night I was holding my girls on my lap when they began to play a little rough.&#160; I reminded them that there was a baby in my belly and they needed to be gentle.&#160; 

My 4 yr old then said, _“Mom, I don’t think you really have a baby in your belly.&#160; I think it is just food.”_

I assured her there really is a baby in there and reminded her that she’s seen the baby’s picture and heard the heart beat.&#160; 

_“Yea,”_&#160; she said, _“But I think your wrong, I think you’re going to go to the hospital and that is not what is going to come out.”_

So basically, my daughter thinks I am fat and she told me so to my face. 

Motherhood:&#160; Not for the weak of spirit
