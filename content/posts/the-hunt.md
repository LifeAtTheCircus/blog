Countless “winter” afternoons were spent sporting flip flops, eating picnic lunches outside, soaking in the warmth of the sun’s rays.&#160;&#160; And I loved every minute of it, while also inwardly fearing a return of cold weather.&#160; I so hate that time of year when you have to keep both warm and cold weather clothes in your drawers because you never know what the weather will do.&#160; I love it when you can confidently box up last seasons clothes and fully embrace the new season.&#160; 

Which is why, I found it somewhat frustrating, and quite a bit comical that on the second Saturday of SPRING… the day of the annual community Easter Egg Hunt… the kids were bundled up in coats, with red noses and cold hands as they gathered their eggs.&#160; But, the cold wind blowing didn’t dampen the fun too much.&#160;

When we got to the van, she had to run back into the house for her Daisy Hop because “Mom, I promised Daisy Hop I’d bring her to the Easter Egg Hunt!”

This was his first hunt.&#160; His glee was priceless.

Their was a special “magic egg” which was orange with a purple suction cup on it.&#160; Whoever found it got an extra special prize.&#160; I loved my 6 year olds strategy for egg hunting.&#160; She only gathered orange eggs.&#160; It was so cute to see her running around the egg covered field, never giving a second look to any other color egg.

None of the other kids cared what color their eggs were.&#160;

The Easter Bunny also made an appearance.

It was a blustery, but fun morning!
