**BABY!!!!!**

This morning we had our sonogram appointment.&#160; While it is our fourth pregnancy, I try as hard as I can to not take anything for granted.&#160; I don’t think I realized how much I was “holding my breath” so to speak before the appointment.&#160; Words can’t adequately express the feelings of thanksgiving that overwhelmed me when the tech and then the doctor told us that everything looked healthy and normal.&#160; 

As if that wasn’t blessing enough, we were blessed with an amazing, go the extra mile, super kind tech.&#160; We brought the whole circus with us.&#160; She let us point out things to the children.&#160; She then printed a picture of the baby waving for each kid and even typed their names on each picture so that they each got a picture of the baby saying hi to them.&#160; This totally melted my mommy’s heart. 

And the baby completely 
cooperated 
 put on a show for us.&#160; The baby waved, put his her hand on his/her face…grabbed his/her feet… and even yawned.&#160; It was truly amazing to watch.&#160; I don’t recall any of the other children being so animated during our sonograms.&#160; 

![image](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image2.png "image")It was a precious moment of bonding for our now family of 6 as we stared at the screen this morning.&#160; I am so overwhelmingly thankful…for the life that lives inside me, for the lives asleep in the room beside mine who are eagerly awaiting the arrival of their baby brother or sister, for their Daddy whose smile lit up the room when he saw his baby for the first time, for the technology that provided this wonderful bonding experience and the tech whose patience and care made the visit all the more special.&#160;
