Last week my mom came and spent the week with us.&#160; My parents live 5 hrs away from us and even though they do an awesome job of coming to visit for weekends, it always seems like the visit is over before it starts and I am often left wishing I had some more time to spend with them.&#160; Having mom here for a week was such a blessing.&#160; Not only did she do my laundry for me all week as well as cook our dinners and even do the dishes, but she also shared my days with me.&#160; A treat I don’t often get to enjoy with her.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

We had a blast…&#160; she took the kids for bike rides, raced my 2 yr old on the basketball court, went swimming in the bay with the kids, let them help with dinner preparations, watched Scott’s sailing race, worked on projects—(such as building an ant farm, and sewing cow costumes for Cow Appreciation Day), ate picnic lunches on the deck, enjoyed tea and scones for lunch, and snuggled the baby…

Thanks Mom… for a fabulous week!!&#160;
