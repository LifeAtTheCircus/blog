_“You take the good, you take the bad,       
you take them both and there you have        
The Facts of Life, the Facts of Life_.”

Blogging is funny, as many of you bloggers know, because when you write a post, you’re really writing a snapshot of a moment in time.&#160; And as as the author (or photographer, if you will) you get to choose which moment in time you post and thus you can largely shape the perception of your self and your family life that you present to the world. 

And I struggle with this. 

Because, I love my life.&#160; I really do.&#160; I love being married to Scott.&#160; I love being Mom to my 4 kids, and I love being able to stay home with them full time.&#160; And so at the end of the day, I often choose to reflect on those good moments throughout the day.&#160; Because every day has them.&#160; And I don’t want to be one of those negative people who complains and rants and dwells on the bad.&#160; (because oh, by the way, each day has plenty of _those_ moments too).&#160; 

And here lies the struggle for me, because I long to keep it real, to not put on a facade of having it more together than I do.&#160; I honestly do not enjoy being around “perfect people” or those that appear to be juggling their many roles without every dropping a ball or getting hit on the head.&#160; I get hit on the head quite often and I want to show my real self, but I want to do it without whining.&#160; 

As I sat down to write a post for today, I thought about reflecting on our week of homeschooling.&#160; Here lies a perfect example of the inner struggle. 

We’ve had some great moments this week.&#160; I could tell you more about our field trip to the [butterfly tunnel](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/03/02/field-trip-fun-2/) on Tuesday and how the kids had a blast riding the Metro into DC and how the day ended so well with dinner at Chick-Fil-A on a family fun night (wahoo--- kids eat free with adult combo meal and awesome face paint lady was there too).&#160; It was a great day!&#160; And not only did we have fun, but I really think the kids learned about the stages of butterfly development and had a good time seeing the butterflies fly up close and personal, instead of just reading about it in a book.&#160; 

I love field trips!&#160; (hence the good)

But, life is not all field trips.&#160; And I could also look back on this week and tell you about the day my son spent 45 minutes, yes 45 minutes doing his handwriting… not b/c he was working so painstakingly slow to get it right and do a good job, but b/c he didn’t feel like working and so he piddled around and whined and complained… and I prompted…. and got frustrated…. and pleaded…. and raised my voice…. as we were trying to get our work done so that we could go on this really awesome field trip!&#160; (the bad)

Or I could write about today…. we spent a good deal of time at the dry erase board reviewing blends and special sounds and reading words that “break the rules” and he was doing it.&#160; He was reading!&#160; (sometime I often lose sight of the magnificence of in my shortsighted focus of today’s task).&#160;&#160; And he wasn’t giving up.&#160; And the girls were playing nicely in the other room so we could focus.&#160; (the good)

Of course fast forward a few hours and we have multiple children in time out for disobedience, tantrums from everyone and a hastily colored page in his book.&#160; (the bad)

The facts of life are, much like the jingle from the 80s show theme song state, you gotta take the good with the bad.&#160; We’ve got both.&#160; And I long to present the full picture without negativity. (not exactly sure how to do that, but it is my goal)

This afternoon we’re going to bake scones and have high tea as an extension of our study of England in Social Studies earlier this week.&#160; If I post pictures tomorrow of the kids all dressed up, eating their tiny sandwiches and smiling at the camera, don’t assume this is how we looked all day.&#160; It’s a moment, an activity, I’ve been looking forward to all week and will want to cherish and remember it, and yet I also know that between now and high tea, we have to go to the grocery store for those special ingredients, and swing by the post office to mail a package and buy stamps… and since I’ve been a mom for almost 6 yrs now, I know we’ll have many of _those_ moments before (or IF) we get to our Kodak moment.&#160; 

I’m just banking on the fact that 20 years from now, when the kids are grown and gone, and I look back on today’s snap shot…I’ll probably only remember the good.&#160;&#160;&#160; It’s just the facts of life.
