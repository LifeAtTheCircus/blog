  Most scrapbooks include pictures of baby's first steps, first food, first drink from a sippy cup... but where do you put the picture of the first time baby ripped the wallpaper border above her crib?

In our house it's become a sort of right of passage.

Thank goodness we had lots of extra border from the first time we did the nursery.  Poor Winnie the Pooh has been ripped 3 different times!

When my son ripped it we didn't bother replacing it until we moved him to his big boy room and got the nursery set up for the next baby.   Shortly before my daughter was born we replaced it and Pooh was fine until my daughter was a little over a year old.  One day she too noticed the border puckering out at the bottom and took a nice rip out of the border.   By this time I was pregnant, again, and we left it that way until she had moved into her toddler bed in her new room with her big brother.  And, shortly before baby number 3 was born, we fixed the border, _again.  I guess it became one of our routine baby prep chores...replace border above crib before packing hospital bag!_

One day last week I went in to get my youngest daughter from her crib after her nap.  I had heard her babbling in there for quite a while.  Turns our she has now reached our unofficial family milestone.  

I guess something about that border just begs to be torn as my little tots lay in their crib staring up at it.

Now the question is, how long will the border stay like that if we don't have a hospital bag to pack first?
