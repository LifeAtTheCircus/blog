He said, "Woah!  I gotta slow down, I am eating too fast!"  I asked him where he heard that and he said, "Daddy, when he saw a 2 and a 0 on the scale he said, "Woah, I gotta slow down and stop eating so many cookies."  (Please note, I got permission from Daddy to post this anecdote.)

Oh course, she wanted to get in on the action as well.  I figured I should chronicle this, b/c not many girls actually WANT to get on the scale, then actually allow a camera present and then SMILE during the process... ah, to be young!!
