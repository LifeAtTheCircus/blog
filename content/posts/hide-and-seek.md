We have a tradition at our house that we do every day when Daddy comes home.&#160; I don't know exactly when or how it started, but as soon as Maggie (our dog) barks to let us know he's home, my older two children dash and hide.&#160; Daddy then has to find them.&#160; I'm sure the words, &quot;Daddy's home...HIDE!&quot;&#160; were just the words he longed to hear after a hard day of work, but he always plays along and looks &quot;high and low&quot; till he finds them and is greeting with smiles and giggles.&#160; My son has actually gotten quite good at hiding, but my daughter still has a lot to learn.&#160;
