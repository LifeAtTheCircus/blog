We’ve been battling some germs here at the circus.&#160; Everything from ear infections, stomach bugs, croup, asthma attacks… we seem to have had it all, and then had it again.&#160; 

After this week’s bout of croup went from kid to kid (with the baby waking up today with a fever) I am thinking Momma could use some chocolate.&#160;&#160; So, during nap time today I plan to whip up some of these (my favs) and enjoy a little chocolate fix while I try to catch up on some blog reading and commenting.&#160; For those of you that have stopped over this week from the [UBP](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/03/19/its-party-time/), I am eager to stop on over to your blogs as well.&#160;&#160;
