 My son is an individual.  Despite the fact that his parents are [crazy football fans](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/19/star-struck/) and could care less about baseball, he decided when he was about 2 that he loved baseball.  He'd willingly sit and watch it on TV.  We've even Tivoed a few games for him or let him watch portions of Sports Center.  We've taken him to a few minor league games in the past, but tonight we took our oldest two children to their first Major League Baseball Game.   

As we drove to the ballpark, my son started singing the song and said, "Come on everyone join me"  

So please join us...

A good time was had by all.  And the looks on my kids faces as they took in the sights, sounds, and tastes of the ball field was my absolute favorite part.
