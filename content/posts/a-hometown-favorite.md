Even though I have lived in MD for 30 out of my 35 years, I am not really much of a Marylander.  Can’t stand the taste or smell of crabs or any sea food….stepping foot on a boat sends me into an all out panic attack, and I am a die hard Steelers fan.  

However, the one local tradition I fully stand behind is the Blue Angels show every May.  Growing up I only recall watching it from the field of our high school, as they soared overhead.  But, ever since I stopped working in 2004, I have made it to every single show.  

And I love it.

What an amazing show it is.

And this year the weather was PERFECT.

70 degrees, sunny… not a cloud in the sky.

Family fun at its finest.

These are the moments I cherish.   Sitting in a grassy field, watching the kids play and then watching the jets swarm overhead.

ha!  I love this picture… my youngest very seriously taking the pics on Dad’s phone, while I am excitedly pointing out the Blue Angels and my oldest is going, “Dad, their over there…. get the picture!”
