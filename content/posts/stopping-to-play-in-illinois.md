We set out from our friends in Iowa and headed north east.&#160; Our destination was the suburbs of Chicago. Scott and I visited Chicago last year for our anniversary and while I loved the city and would love to visit it again, we didn’t feel this was the trip to take the family into the city.&#160; Instead we planned a stop at Lego Discovery Center outside of the city.&#160;

We watched 2 different 4D lego themed movies.&#160; I was impressed with the Lego displays.&#160;&#160; My 7 year old enjoyed pretending to pick their noses.&#160; The kids and Scott also really enjoyed just sitting and playing with Legos.&#160; They each designed their own cars and raced them down the track.&#160; 

Afterwards we drove about 20 minutes to a beautiful area of the Chicago suburbs to visit [![IMG_4838](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4838.jpg "IMG_4838")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4838.jpg)an ADORABLE train themed restaurant that my friend had told me about.&#160; I knew my train loving three year old would love it and HE DID!&#160; The restaurant was located right beside a train stop.&#160; The highlight of our vacation for my three year old has been spotting the choo-choo trains as we have passed them all around the country.&#160; And we have seen some pretty big choo choo trains go by.&#160; Whenever they do he very enthusiastically sings out, “Chug a chug a chug a chug a… CHOO CHOO!” with an emphatic fist pump at the end.&#160; So, when we saw a train up close and the engineer blew his whistle for us, that was pretty exciting.&#160; 

Then we went inside to a complete train the[![IMG_4851](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4851.jpg "IMG_4851")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4851.jpg)med restaurant in which a model train brings you&#160; your dinner on its railroad car.&#160; How cool is that?&#160; The waitresses were super friendly and very easy going about the “chug a chugging” my three year old did when the train passed by his place.&#160; While eating we got to watch several more large trains go by our window.

To top it off, the food was delicious!&#160; It was a super fun family evening.&#160;
