The time had finally come for the tooth to be pulled.   While our son was  more than ready for it to come out, Dad was secretly uneasy about the venture.  “He trusts me” Scott confided to me in the hallway, “What if I hurt him?”   Then Scott got another one of his moments of sheer fatherhood brilliance.  

“I’ll let him do it,” he declared.  

He tied one end of the dental floss to his light saber and the other to his tooth.  

The girls gathered around eager to see the tooth pop out.  I stood by with the video camera rolling and the epic light saber battle began.  

Father and son wielded their sabers.  

The floss flew out of his mouth and out popped his tooth.[![IMG_9877](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_9877.jpg "IMG_9877")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_9877.jpg)  

The look of pure glee on his face when he looked down and saw his tooth hanging there was priceless.
