The other day the kids and I were 
hanging around the house
 cleaning the house like crazy and listening to music.&#160; “The Sharing Song” by Jack Johnson came on and he sang, “It’s always more fun to share with everyone.”&#160; My three year old got a funny look on her face and exclaimed, “Hey, he said it’s more fun to share!&#160; It is NOT more fun to share!”&#160; 

The way she said it and the look on her face was if she was saying, W_hat is this propaganda your spewing at me mom? We all know it is no fun sharing._

While I would contest that is definitely good to share and something we strive to teach here at the circus, I guess I can concede that is isn’t _always more fun to share.&#160;&#160;&#160;_ But then again, we don’t share b/c it’s more fun, we share because it is kind and being kind towards others is one way we can glorify our Lord.&#160; Sometimes the fun is a great byproduct, sometimes it isn’t fun at all.&#160; 

   









 

How about you?&#160; Do you agree with Jack that it is always more fun to share or are you in agreement with my daughter?
