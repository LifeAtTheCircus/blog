We took a lot of pictures of my son’s first baseball game of the season,

[![baseball collague](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/baseballcollague.jpg "baseball collague")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/baseballcollague.jpg) 

but without a doubt, this one is my favorite. 

[![this look says it all](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/thislooksaysitall.jpg "this look says it all")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/thislooksaysitall.jpg)

His look truly says it all.&#160;&#160; Is that the face of a happy ball player or what?

This is what little league is all about…the pure love of the game.&#160; May he never outgrow it.
