I love that my 3 yr old will happily dress herself in the morning, without even needing to be told.&#160; I need, however,&#160; to work with her on not wearing clashing patterns...&#160; checkered meets stripes…meets polka dots…

Oh My!!

Apparently, I also need to have the “less is more” discussion with her on make up application.&#160; [![IMG_8953](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMG_8953.jpg "IMG_8953")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMG_8953.jpg)

Unless of course she plans to be a clown when she grows up.&#160; 

And yes, if you were wondering… I did in fact let her leave the house this way b/c 

A.&#160; I thought her sense of style (or lack there of) was precious..

B.&#160; We were running late and I didn’t have time to engage in the ward robe battle.

C.&#160; We were going to a friends house for art class, which even though this meant we’d see 8 other families worth of kids, some how in my head it didn’t count as going out in public

_…makes me wonder which one of us will get more mileage out of these pictures in the black mail category… me as I show her future boy friends her cute little fashion sense or her when she asks “What kind of a Mom lets her kid go out of the house dressed like that?”_
