This weekend we celebrated our youngest daughter’s 6th birthday.&#160; Since her reoccurring theme of the year was all things feline, it came as no surprise to me when she requested we have a cat themed birthday party.&#160; 

Because she doesn’t like cake, she requested brownies with little plastic cats on each one.&#160; (For real, those were her exact words)&#160; I was more than happy to grant that simple request. (_hands down easiest birthday cake I’ve done for one of my kids_)

She also wanted a piñata.&#160; I was a bit nervous about pulling this one off, but we were actually able to find a kitty cat piñata&#160; at the party store.&#160;&#160; I’ve done a lot of piñatas over the years, and I gotta say this was the best one we’ve had.&#160; So often they are impossible to break, this one did actually break and it broke little by little giving everyone a chance to let out some candy.&#160; The kids seemed to really enjoy it. Actually, we all got a kick out of watching them swing at the piñata.&#160; Though it was a little odd to see all these children swinging a baseball bat at cute little kitty cat.&#160;&#160;

When it came time to open her presents, the gift from her siblings (and thus Mom and Dad as well) was a scratching post to signify that we are going to grant her request of the past 6+ months and allow her to have a real kitten.&#160;&#160; Her older brother came to us months ago and asked if he could get her a kitten for her birthday.&#160; Looks like the circus family is about to grow even more as we are on the look out for a kitty cat to join this crazy crew!
