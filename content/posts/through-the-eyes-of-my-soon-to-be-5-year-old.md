When my oldest doesn’t take a nap, I am often looking for creative ways for him to play quietly while the girls sleep and I do “whatever I do” during nap time.&#160; 

Often time he plays quietly in his nap room (I separate the kids during nap time so they aren’t sleeping in the same room) or will play a computer game.&#160; Some days, however, I give him the point and shoot and let him have fun with his artistic side.&#160; 

Man, does he have fun with it too.

One day he came up from nap and asked me to download the pics onto our computer.&#160; He had taken 88 pictures in 20 min in the guest room! 

He comes by it naturally though, as now that we are “digital” Scott and I have a tendency to snap quite a few, resulting in 2 external hard drives for picture storage. Ahem!

So here are some pictures taken by my son over the past month or so. 

I love his little feet peeking out at the bottom in this one.

His patient model.

(If you only knew the 15 or so shots he took of her wearing the scarf and hat).

Another day he had fun snapping pics while I was typing on the computer.

Don’t I look “lovely”?&#160; Just keeping it real for ya folks!

These are some of my favs… I love his use of perspective.

&#160;

Took me a long time to figure out what the shot below is of.&#160; Any guesses?

Here are a few from his Self Portait Series.

I know this one is fuzzy, but I love it too much to leave it out.
