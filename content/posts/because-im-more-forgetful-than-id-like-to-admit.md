The one piece of parenting advice I wish I had adhered to better is to “write down those cute things your kids say b/c you will forget.”&#160; 

_Me forget?&#160; Come on… there’s not way I could forget those cute little things my kids say… I’m super mom._

Yea, I also never thought I’d bring my kids to church with mismatched shoes and no diaper bag…but

5 years and 3 kids later and super mom has left the building.&#160; 

So, when I found out about [this carnival](http://notbefore7.blogspot.com/2009/06/tiny-talk-tuesday_30.html), I thought it sounded like a great way to write down those things my kids say which I swear I’d never forget and quite often by the time Scott is home from work, I've already forgotten…they may not be incredibly profound or hilarious, but years from now I am sure I’ll be glad to have them recorded.&#160;

3 year old says to me at dinner on a swim class day, “Mom, I got wet when I went swimming.&#160; Every time I go that happens.”

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5 year old son, “Mom do want me to grow up?”&#160; 

me:&#160; “Well I’ll probably miss the days when we could sit and snuggle together when you were little.”

son: “Don’t worry mom, when I am a grown up I will come over every day and snuggle with you.”

23 mth old, (reaching hands to sky) “can’t reach moon… can’t reach it!”

5 year old brother says, “Don’t worry, when I grow up I’ll take you there b/c I am going to be an astronaut.”

After watching the Orioles lose to the Red Sox my 3 year old was on the phone with her grandpa and said, “It was a bummer the Red Sox won, but I still had a good time because we brought food.”

After going on a pirate adventure for our father’s day celebration this kids all retuned home with gold coins.&#160; The next day my 5 yr old son was carrying around his sack of coins and asked I could help him with his “tax appointment.”

And while it isn’t exactly a quote, it cracked me up nonetheless… on Saturday morning after I made pancakes for breakfast, I sent my sweet little daughter in to wake up Daddy and tell him breakfast was ready.&#160; When I got no response, I went down the hall and found this….

Nothing says rise and shine like your little girl standing over you with a toy rifle.
