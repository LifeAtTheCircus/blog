Some may call it a sickness.

Others may think of me more as a loyalist.

It all stems back to an experience I had as a middle schooler.

Who knew that a trip to the grocery store could have such a lasting impact on a girl?

I was shopping with my mom one day when I was an early teen and they were conducting a blind taste test for Coke and Pepsi.&#160; Before this time I'd drink either, never really seeing a difference or a big deal.

Then I took one sip, and literally my life was never the same.&#160; Ok, actually it was two sips.

They had the cola beverages in dixie cups behind a cardboard sign.&#160; Very official stuff here people.&#160; I drank from one dixie cup.&#160; Pause.&#160; Sipped from the other cup.&#160; I picked one and... drum roll please... turns out I preferred Coke to Pepsi.

Now I am 29 years old and a Coke snob.&#160; I will not drink the other guy.&#160; Don't care how badly my body is craving that bubbly, sugary, caffeinated goodness, if they only serve Pepsi, I'll take water.&#160; I actually don't understand why places serve Pepsi.&#160; Last week my husband and I went on a [date](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/28/ive-got-a-hot-date-tonight/) to Applebees and all day I had been looking forward to bottomless cokes at dinner.&#160; You can not imagine how shocked I was to learn that they only served Pepsi products.&#160; That's ok... I took my water and consoled myself that I could then drink a soda at the theatre.&#160;&#160; I was so excited as we went to the movie b/c&#160; I was going to get my first drink at a movie theatre (we never cough up food money at the theater but this time the tickets had been free).&#160; I was outraged to learn that they too only served Pepsi.&#160; WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?&#160; Do people really, actually prefer Pepsi?&#160; I was shocked and appalled.&#160; Scott said that Pepsi is the hip drink of the new generation.&#160; Coke, he says, is for romantics and loyalists.&#160; (I'd be interested in your opinion on this one)

&#160;

My love for Coke runs deep and wide.&#160; When my husband and I were on a cross country trip a few years ago, I got an incredible craving for a cold Coke during our drive through Utah... the desolate, never ending salt flats of Utah to be precise... not a lot of rest stops here.&#160;&#160; But as we were driving we did see one and I was ecstatic... delirious with joy I tell you.&#160; Not sure if it was the caffeine or the 12 hrs of riding in the car, but we needed a break and thought it would be fun to take some pictures.&#160; Here are our pictures of me in the salt flats enjoying that sweet nectar.&#160;

&#160; 

These are pictures that I am kind of embarrassed to admit made the scrapbook.&#160; Oh, the mocking my children will do to me when they get their hands on these later...

&#160;

I still can't believe I actually did this, and made a scrapbook page about it none the less.&#160; I am such a dork!&#160; In my defense it was a REALLY long day on the road.
