Here are the top 10 reasons why my family loves to go camping.

**10. It's cheaper than a hotel**

($20 a night versus $150 a night)[![A mother daughter moment](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/a-mother-daughter-moment-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/a-mother-daughter-moment.jpg) 

**9. Smores!**

**8.  It ensures that the ground will get the water its been deprived of all summer long.**

**6. Togetherness**

_(look how cozy our beds look in there...we almost always wake with at least one kiddo snuggled up next to us)_

**5. Dining al fresco**

_(some people pay big bucks to eat in the great outdoors)_

**4.  Everything tastes better when it's cooked over a fire**[![IMG_6887](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-6887-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-6887.jpg)  

_(note the distance between my daughter's hot dog and the actual fire...not exactly cooked)_

**3.  Daddy does most of the cooking**

**2.  The kids can play freely and without worry of breaking things.**

_(lest you think we are horrid parents, this was NOT the fire pit we used for the campfire)_

**1.  You don't have to be clean**

(_anytime one of us went to take a shower or clean up while camping, my son would say, "But Mom, when your camping you don't have to be clean!")_

 

We went on a few camping trips this summer and made many priceless memories.  To read what other people did this summer, check out [Kristen's](http://www.wearethatfamily.com) Sizzling Summer Vacation Spectacle.
