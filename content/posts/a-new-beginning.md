Scott commented the other day that he feels the passage of time more noticeably at the beginning of the school year, rather than on the kids birthdays.&#160; 

I think he’s right.

Especially this year, when I packed up three backpacks and three lunch boxes and lined up 3 kids for pictures at the front door.&#160; 

We have our Kindergartener, on her very first day of school ever.&#160; [![IMG_6512](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_6512.jpg "IMG_6512")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_6512.jpg)

Followed by our first grader. [![IMG_6521](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_6521.jpg "IMG_6521")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_6521.jpg)

And, then our third grader.

They were all eager to go to “school at the building” today at their tutorial.&#160; I wonder if they’ll be as excited tomorrow for “school at the kitchen table.” I think, by far, the most excited was my 5 year old… she’s been eagerly waiting for her turn for several years now.&#160; [![IMG_6545](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_6545.jpg "IMG_6545")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_6545.jpg)

I hope and pray that it is a good school year for all of us.&#160;
