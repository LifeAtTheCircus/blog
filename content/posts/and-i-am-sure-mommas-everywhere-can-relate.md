This afternoon I was finishing up in the shower, when my youngest walked into the bathroom.&#160;&#160;&#160; I told him, “Hold on bud, Momma’ just needs a minute.&#160; Can you give me some privacy?”

His response?

No Mommy. I can’t.&#160; I can’t find your pivacy.&#160; 

Neither can I…. going on 9 years now since I lost it.
