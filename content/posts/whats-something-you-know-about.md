My son always has tons of questions about the world around him and the way things work.&#160; Most of the time, I am at a loss as to how to answer these questions.&#160; For example, the other day he wanted to know about signals and how we could see them.&#160; As in, radio signals or cell phone signals.&#160; He wondered if they were like infrared light and could only be seen with special glasses or if we can’t see them at all.&#160; I had no clue and suggested he bring the topic up with his dad b/c, “Daddy knows a lot about signals and things like that.”&#160;&#160; I’ll be honest… quite often, I have to suggest he bring his question to Daddy b/c Daddy knows a lot about that subject.&#160; Like how e-mails make it from our computer to Daddy’s work….or infrared light making the remote tell the tv to turn on…and countless other things. 

So, I found it particularly endearing the other night when the two of us were driving to catechism and he says, “Mom, what’s something you know about that Daddy doesn’t?”&#160; I had to think a minute b/c to be honest, I think Scott is quite a bit smarter than I am b/c he has spent his life questioning things and finding out how things work and why they work.&#160;&#160; But, here was my 5 year old seeking me out, to find out what he could ask me about that I would know the answer to.&#160; It totally warmed my heart. So, I said, “Well, I know a little about cooking and Daddy doesn’t.”&#160;&#160; “Tell me about cooking, Mom,”&#160; “What do you know?”&#160; Hmm… how does one answer such an open ended question.&#160; For some reason, I started telling him about cooking things from scratch over using a mix.&#160; I told him with a boxed mix, you typically just add a few ingredients, but when you cook from scratch you have to basically make the mix.&#160; It often takes more work, but typically it tastes better than a mix.&#160; We talked about cookies and brownies and how we don’t make brownies that often.&#160; (I am more a sucker for chocolate chip cookies than brownies).&#160;&#160; 

2 days later I was looking around the kitchen to make a dessert to take to our friend’s house for dinner.&#160; I found a recipe for mint chocolate brownies on the back of the mint chocolate chip bag.&#160; As the kids and I began to bake them, my son said, “Hey, is this baking from scratch?”&#160; Indeed it was.&#160; 

I love that my son wanted to take the time to learn from me and and get to know more about my interests and “expertise.”&#160; And I loved how he recalled that conversation a few days later.&#160;&#160;&#160; It was one of those bonding moments, that I want to savor.&#160;
