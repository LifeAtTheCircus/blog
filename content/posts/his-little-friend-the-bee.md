While picnicking at the orchard last weekend, a bee made his way to our 4 year olds apple.&#160;&#160; As it buzzed around and lingered around his hands, Scott thought that it might freak him out so he started to swat it away. 

“No Daddy!” our 4 year old protested, “he’s trying to become my friend!”
