I’ve been hosting this little carnival of mine for a few months now and was hoping for some feedback.&#160;&#160; I am wondering how often you think we should run weekend thoughts?&#160; Is once a week too much?&#160; Would you prefer once a month?&#160; Or every other week?&#160; 

Any other suggestions for improving the carnival? Anything I can do to make it easier?&#160; 

For those that have linked up in the past, thank you.&#160; I have loved reading your thoughts and getting to know you better.&#160;&#160;&#160; Please link up below with your thoughtful post. 

For those that haven’t linked up, I still greatly appreciate your comments for improving the carnival.&#160;
