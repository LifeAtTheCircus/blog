Our oldest daughter had a little fun getting into her character for Halloween.&#160; When posing for pictures in their costumes, she decided to&#160; fully act out the part of Snow White.

I think my favorite part of the reenactment was when she asked us to take her picture sleeping with the apple. _&quot;Skip the ol posing by the door with the trick or treat basket, we’ll go for playing dead on the floor with an apple.”_

Then she was awakened with a kiss from her prince.

“Thanks Dad for being my prince,” she exclaimed.

Oh sweet girl, there’s nothing he’d like more than to be your prince forever.

_Excuse me while I go blubber in the corner as I think about this picture one day popping up on the screen during a video montage at her rehearsal dinner… can’t you just stay our little girl forever?&#160;_
