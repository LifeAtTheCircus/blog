Nothing like a back seat driver.&#160; 

Especially a 3 year old back seat driver. 

At 1 am.&#160; On a Snow covered back country road.

As we slip slided around the roads approaching my parents the other night, I seriously thought we might end up in a ditch and all the while my 3 year old was WIDE awake and chattering non stop about all the snow.&#160; He kept saying, “Dad, don’t get in an accident.&#160; We wouldn’t want to get in an accident and die dad.”&#160; 

Over and over.&#160; 

Truthfully, it provided a little comic relief to Scott and I as the conditions were less than ideal. 

Thankfully, we made it safely.&#160; And my dad greeted us with his plow and tractor.&#160; At 2 am.&#160; He was out plowing the driveway.&#160; My three old thought he was out to give him a tractor ride.&#160; We figured, “Why not.&#160; It wasn’t like he was asleep.”&#160; Besides, how often do you get the opportunity for a 2 am tractor ride in the snow.&#160;

The snow was gorgeous and we had a wonderful day on Wednesday.&#160; My poor mom had to work, so I offered to bake the pies.&#160; I baked while my Dad and Scott played in the snow with the kids.&#160; All day.&#160;

Then, the only thing that could make playing in 8 inches of snow at your grandparents EVEN MORE FUN, was the addition of 4 cousins and an uncle.&#160; [![IMG_8300](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_8300.jpg "IMG_8300")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_8300.jpg)

Thanksgiving was a low key relaxing day.&#160; We did a photo opp for Grandma’s Christmas card.&#160; They went sledding again.&#160; They did crafts and my grandparents came for a visit.&#160;&#160; Then we ate our feast, enjoyed those pies and ended it all with watching the Steelers/Ravens game.&#160; It was an ALMOST perfect day.&#160; _(darn that painful loss to our rival)_

It was a wonderful visit.&#160; Full of family and fun and snuggles, beautiful snow and yummy food.&#160; I am grateful, so very grateful for my family and the opportunity to spend a few days with them.
