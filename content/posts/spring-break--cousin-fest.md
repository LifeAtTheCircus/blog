Last week was spring break at the circus.&#160; It was an action packed week full of family fun.&#160; We played lots and lots of games, rode bikes, and the trampoline was pretty much in use non stop.&#160; 

We had Aunt Karen and the boys here from Sun night till Tuesday.&#160;

Wednesday we went to Philly and Thursday night my parents and my nieces and nephew came to town till Easter.&#160; My brother joined us on Sat and Scottâ€™s parents came for lunch on Sat and again on Easter for lunch and egg hunt.

It was a blast!&#160; Every time my 3 year old prayed he thanked God that we were all together.&#160; I was thankful too.&#160; Warms my heart to see the cousins playing together.&#160;
