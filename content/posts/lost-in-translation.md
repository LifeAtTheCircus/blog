Ever play the game [Mad Gab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Gab)?  One team holds up a card with a gibberish phrase and the other team has to translate it.  Translating what my two year old says is a lot like playing this game.  

Case in point, last week my daughter was teasing my mom.  My mom wanted her to call her Grandma and she knew this so she would call her everything _but_ that.  As they looked each other in the eye their charade went something like this...  

Grandma:  Hi Girlie Girl  (Giggle giggle)  

Daughter:  Hi Mommy  (Giggle giggle)  

Grandma:  Ok, Hi Papa  (Giggle giggle)  

Daughter:  Hi Tommy  (Giggle giggle)  

Grandma:  Hi Daddy  (Giggle giggle)  

Daughter:  Hi (I have no idea how to type this phrase phonetically.  I am going to let you listen to it because what she intended and what is sounded like are two _very_ different things. Click on the little triangle to hear [](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/hi-racecar.mp3)).    

Yea... poor Grandma heard "Hi Retard" and didn't know what to say.  I swear you could have heard a pin drop after that as ever single person in the room seemed to hear it and freeze.  

I quickly translated...  

She said, "Hi race car"  

Daughter:  Yea, Hi retard  

Grandma and the rest of the room:  Huge sigh of relief as poor Grandma thought her two year old grand daughter had called her a retard.
