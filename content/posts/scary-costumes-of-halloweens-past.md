 This week the assignment for [THAT Family's](http://www.wearethatfamily.com) carnival, was to post a scary pic from the past.  So, I started looking through some old Halloween photos trying to find just the right one...  

I was never much into scary, though I did sport a mask in this costume when I was 4 or 5.

My son however, seems to take the prize for his scary costumes...

Here he is at 6 mths sporting his ferocious dragon attire. (If you look closely, you can see that [laundry](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/13/the-bane-of-my-existence/) has never been high on my to do list).

The next year the Ravens were playing the Steelers on Halloween Night  for Monday Night Football.  What would be more scary to wear in Maryland, then a [Ben Roethlisberger](http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/players/6770) jersey?  He had those Ravens fans trembling!

And who can rest with this terrifying lion on the prowl?[![ROAR!!](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/roar-thumb1.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/roar1.jpg)
