I know that many think Valentine’s day is just a day created by Hallmark.&#160; Others think it’s a cheesy holiday for saps.&#160;&#160; Say what you will, I’ll jump at a chance for a date night with my hubby.&#160; And I don’t mind a sweet card and some cinnamon heart candy either. 

But, after having kids, Scott and I found it rather difficult to go out for Valentine’s day.&#160; Since we don’t hire babysitters, we typically rely on friends or grandparents for babysitting and you can’t ask another couple to babysit for you on Valentine’s Day.&#160; So, for a few years we just did an in home date night after putting the little one (and then ones) to bed.&#160; 

But, then one year we got an idea that we both LOVED and a tradition was born.&#160; 

We decided to celebrate Valentine’s day on the 7th instead of the 14th.&#160;&#160; This way, we weren’t asking anyone to skip out on their own Valentine’s plans.&#160; And the best part is, it also frees us up to babysit for a friend so that they can go out on Valentine’s day.&#160; We love it!

This year we babysat for our very dear friends.&#160; Since we had 5 young ones at our house on Valentine’s night, we decided to throw them their own party.&#160; We had heart shaped meatballs and spaghetti for dinner.&#160;

&#160;

Then we did a fun painting craft after dinner.&#160; I asked the kids their favorite craft and they told me painting.&#160; So, I found these wooden hearts at Michael’s for $1 each.&#160; Throw in some acrylic paint and some old tee shirts and we were set for fun!

We topped the evening off with a heart shaped cake.&#160; (check out the recipe [here](http://baking.about.com/od/cakes/r/strawberry.htm)…it was so fun to make).&#160; Mental note:&#160; need 2 tubs of icing next time!

Unfortunately, we weren’t able to go out on the 7th due to one of our many snowstorms this month.&#160; But, we do have plans to go out tonight and I am greatly looking forward to a nice evening out with my man!

Celebrating Valentine’s day, not on Valentine’s day so that we can babysit for our friends is a tradition that totally [works for us](www.wearethatfamily.com).&#160; Visit [here](http://www.5minutesformom.com) or [here](http://sevenclowncircus.com/) for more fun picture posts!
