At the end of last year Scott and I went out for a big fun day date.&#160; As we thought back over the year and looked ahead at the new year we talked about things we wanted to do differently in the coming year.&#160; 

Scott had a few suggestions on the food front.&#160; One was that we eat more meatless dinners.&#160; He was not advocating we go vegetarian…(good thing too b/c this meat and potato loving gal would have surely lasted all of 2 days at best) the other was that we starting eating more fish.&#160; And, truthfully, eating any amount of fish even once would have been significantly more than we’ve ever eaten.&#160; Because, to be honest, I don’t like fish and therefore I don’t cook fish.&#160;&#160; I hide behind the fact that since I don’t eat it, I wouldn’t know how to cook it… but truthfully, it’s because the look, smell, and texture disgust me. 

But, I was willing to give it a try.&#160; Because I love my man.

I decided to instill Meatless Wednesdays at our house and to cook fish for dinner once a month.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 6 weeks into the endeavor and we’re having some successes.&#160;&#160; Actually, more successes than failures!

To be honest, I was skeptical at first.&#160; But, then after scouring the internet and calling on my face book friends, I’ve found it really fun to come up with a whole slew of new recipes to try.&#160; I didn’t realize I had been in a rut, until I discovered how much fun I was having stepping out of my comfort zone and trying new things.&#160; I picked Wednesday b/c it is a night that we are all usually home for dinner.&#160; I didn’t want to launch any new meals when I was flying solo for dinner or when we were eating in the gymnastics waiting room.

Though part way through the month I realized Meatless Mondays would have had more of a ring to it, with the alliteration factor and all… but we’re kinda all stuck on meatless Wednesday and when you gotta good thing, you don’t want to mess with it.&#160; (in fact, last week when Scott came home and saw our dinner he said, “_Oh it must be Wednesday'!_”)

Anyway, I thought I’d share some of our successes and failures for Meatless Wednesday

**
Squash Ravioli
**—this was delicious, it was so sweet and everyone in the family loved it.&#160; I was delighted to find Safeway carried in their own generic brand.&#160; Not only is it meatless, it is easy.. Boil water, pop in ravioli, 7 minutes later serve with melted buttered on top.&#160;&#160; (definitely added to our meal rotation)

[**
Sweet Potato Burritos
**](http://craftyscafe.blogspot.com/2009/04/sweet-potato-burritos-ole-42409.html)-&#160; another hit.&#160; This tasted like comfort food to me.&#160; My oldest son loved it as did both my husband and I.&#160; The girls and my youngest ate it, not their favorite, but not a huge fight put up either.&#160; Have already served it twice and will continue to serve it regularly.&#160; It is quick, easy, and also great for eating on the go… like say, at gymnastics….

**
Mexican Pierogies.
**- hmmm, not such a hit.&#160; I knew well enough to serve the ingredients individually rather than all together when serving the kids.&#160; Which helped… the girls don’t care for potatoes so needless to say they weren’t so fond of the pierogies.… they ate the noodle on the outside.&#160;&#160; My oldest son loved them.&#160; When I served them for Scott and I by combining the tomatoes, beans and pierogies, I kinda messed it up, so it didn’t turn out quite right.&#160; All that to say, I can see pierogies. making another appearance, but first time around wasn’t a smashing success. 


**Squash Tortellini**
- I tried a variation on a recipe from Wegmans which for some reason won’t link up right now… basically I served normal tortellini, using squash soup as the sauce, with chunks of squash in there too.&#160; Scott wasn’t a fan.&#160; He felt the squash soup was too sweet and too much for him.&#160; I am wondering if he would have liked it better with the goat cheese stuffed tortellini.&#160; But, I didn’t think the kids would.&#160; The kids didn’t really care for the soup either.&#160; I didn’t mind it, but didn’t love it either.&#160; Probably won’t be serving that one again.&#160; 


**Pad Thai with Tofu**
-&#160; this was so, so good… basically peanut butter sauce over noodles, was how I described it to the kids.&#160; The boys both devoured it, as did Scott and I.&#160; The girls ate it.&#160; Didn’t love it, but ate it. 

**
Tofu-Veggie Hotdogs
**-&#160; I made these for the kids tonight to eat at gymnastics.&#160; My oldest daughter loved them.&#160; She said they didn’t taste like the normal ones, but she still liked them… and ate 3.&#160; No one else cared for them.&#160; And I gotta say, they smelled bad.&#160; My son said, _“What are these?&#160; I know these aren’t made of pig!”_&#160; I think next time we’ll try grilling them and serving with toppings rather than just plain.&#160; But, truthfully, I think they are going to be a hard sell. 


**Fish Nuggets**
- I tried these at lunch a few times.&#160; The only one who likes them is my 4 year old and she LOVES them. But, I think she has proven to be the fish eater of the crew.&#160; She begged for more last time we were at Trader Joes and happily eats them for lunch while the others eat “real” nuggets… aka&#160; chicken

Then there’s fish.&#160; I had heard that tilapia was a good fish for those that don’t like fish.&#160; Since that described me, that was the first fish I opted for.&#160; I baked it with lemon pepper seasoning and served it to the kids and I with ketchup for dipping.&#160; Scott and my 4 year old LOVED it, going back for more on their own free will.&#160; The rest of us ate it.&#160; Which, truthfully is a success.&#160; 

So….. we had it again in Feb already.&#160; (_I’ll be honest, I kinda try to serve it early in the month to get it out of the way, b/c when I make my monthly meal plans I get excited about certain meals, eagerly looking forward to making/eating them… fish isn’t one I’m excited about so I don’t want it hanging over my head all month)._&#160;&#160;&#160; I went with tilapia again b/c it worked last month.&#160; This time, I baked it with seasoned salt for the kids and for Scott and I , I sprinkled seasoned salt and then poured salsa and shredded cheddar on it.&#160; Next time I make it, I will not put the seasoned salt on it… too salty.&#160; Otherwise, Scott loved it and I was able to eat it without ketchup.&#160;&#160; This time all 4 kids willingly ate it all without complaint.&#160;&#160;&#160; Next fish I’m going to try is white ruffy.&#160; Someone posted about it on face book, so being a fish novice, I wrote it down when I saw it and bought it next time I was at Trader Joes.&#160; 

So far, I am enjoying spicing up the menu with some new things.&#160; And the family seems to be embracing it well.&#160; Meatless Wednesdays and Monthly Fish dinners, just might be [working for me](www.wearethatfamily.com) at the circus!

Any of you have any favorite fish or meatless dishes to share?&#160; I’d love to add them to our menu!
