Sometimes I watch my husband as he fathers my kids and he just takes my breath away.&#160; [![a walk with Daddy](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/awalkwithDaddy.jpg "a walk with Daddy")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/awalkwithDaddy.jpg)

I love the way he can explain to my son in terms he can understand how just about anything under the sun works.&#160; I love the way he pulls the kids aside and talks to them about respecting their momma.&#160; I love when he takes one of them with him to church when he has deacon duty so they can have&#160; some special one on one time while he unlocks the church classrooms.&#160; I love watching him out on the soccer field or the baseball field as he assists their coaches and helps guide the team.&#160; I love the way he carefully and gently combs the knots out of my girls hair.&#160; I love the way he makes up goofy love songs for the kids and I and belts them at the top of his lungs around the house.&#160; I love the way he tells them their Bible stories with such excitement and enthusiasm that it seems the characters jump right out of the pages.&#160; I love that he makes spending time with us a priority.&#160; He does everything he can to be there for all of the practices, school events, games, special outings and special moments.&#160; Sometimes it means going in to work early or staying late or working a Sat.&#160; 

I also loves the way he loves me.&#160; 

I love that after 9 yrs and 4 kids, he still looks at me like I am the most beautiful person he’s ever seen.&#160;&#160; I love that he will call me in the middle of the day just to see how I’m doing.&#160;&#160; I love the way he opens the car door for me on date nights.&#160;&#160; I love that he knows me, _really knows me_… the good, the bad, the ugly, the pretty… and yet still he makes me feel adored and cherished.&#160; I love the way he fully supports me and my passions and interests.&#160; I love that he’s a dreamer.&#160; I love making plans and dreams and goals with him for our future.&#160;&#160;&#160; I love traveling with him and trying new things.&#160; He accepts me for what I am, but pushes me to do things I never would do on my own.

This week my husband turned 31.&#160; And as the kids and I did our best to shower him with his favorite things, I couldn’t help but marvel at the man he is and how richly, richly blessed we are to love him and be loved by him.

Happy Birthday my love!&#160;
