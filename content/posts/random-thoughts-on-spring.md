Guess what the kids and I spotted outside this afternoon?&#160;&#160; [![IMG_6298](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6298.jpg "IMG_6298")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6298.jpg)&#160;
**Crocuses!!!**
&#160;&#160; Oh, how I love those little purple blooms… they are the signal to me that spring is around the corner!&#160; And as much as I have loved, (and truly, I know I whined [that one day](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/02/09/my-real-and-honest-thoughts-on-all-this-snow/), but really, I have loved this record breaking snowy winter), but I am excited for spring. 

And I am 
really 
excited… I am looking forward to taking walks with the kids in the evenings.&#160; And I can’t wait to go to the playground and have picnics at the park.&#160; My son is hoping to catch a “keeper” this year and just can’t wait for the first day of fishing season.&#160; My 4 yr is playing soccer for the first time and practice starts next week.&#160; My son’s baseball practice’s start at the end of the month.&#160; I know I’ll be racing around like a crazy mom with shin guards, mitts, water bottles, and snacks, but I love being a little league mom.&#160;&#160; I do… I love watching them run around on the field and screaming for them during games!&#160; I love peeking through the window at my daughter in gymnastics and watching the kids swim around in the pool for swim lessons.&#160; I don’t mind being a Taxi driver, it’s totally worth it when I get there and watch them practice and improve and succeed.&#160; I thoroughly enjoy it!&#160; Did you see that Olympic commercial by PG for moms?&#160; Oh, it gave me goose bumps and a lump in my throat.&#160; 
 









  

&#160;

I told Scott… I think they are right… as awesome as it was for the Olympians, I bet it was 10x better for their moms!!

But, umm, back to spring… 

Last night as my son and I were driving to evening church, I noticed it was 5:45 and the sun had not set. And in less than 2 weeks we get to spring ahead an hour!&#160; Yippee for longer days!&#160; 

Spring really is coming folks!!!&#160; 
2o more days!!
&#160; (mark your calendars now… [Free Rita’s Italian ice](http://www.ritasice.com/events-and-promotions/first-day-of-spring.aspx) on the first day of spring… a circus fam tradition)!

What are you most looking forward to about this spring?
