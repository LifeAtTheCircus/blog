&#160;[![IMG_3203](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_3203.jpg "IMG_3203")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_3203.jpg)Most years when I put together our family scrapbooks, our “Fun in the Snow” spread looks something like this.&#160; Notice the grass poking through the snow and the pathetic little 
snowball 
snowman my son built?

But, this winter has been crazy! We had a [record breaking snowfall](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/12/20/snow-what-fun-2/) in December.&#160; Then, last week we got a good 6 inches of snowfall (which in any normal MD winter, would have made us giddy with excitement).&#160; And today we were blasted with another record breaking and historic snowfall.&#160; [![IMG_5473](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_5473.jpg "IMG_5473")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_5473.jpg) In a way I feel kind of sorry for our kids, because at this young age they are already seeing the most snow they will probably ever see at one time.&#160; It’s all down here from here.&#160; No worries, though, we’ve documented it well and are fully enjoying some fun in the snow.&#160; I am so glad that this year I snagged some boots on sale on Black Friday.&#160; I def got my money’s worth out of em!
