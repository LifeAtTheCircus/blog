12 years ago Scott and I went on our first date.  We went to dinner and then strolled around the shops in downtown Annapolis for midnight Madness.  

I was so excited and nervous.  

This was my first REAL date.

And what could be more romantic than strolling through historic Annapolis listening to Christmas carols? 

Even though we didn't hold hands, (That didn't come until February).  I was still on cloud nine.  

We topped the evening off with milkshakes at [Chic-n-Ruth's](http://www.chickandruths.com/) diner.

This year the city rescheduled the annual tree lighting ceremony for the night of Midnight Madness (due to a rainy day this past Sunday).  Scott called me this afternoon when he heard about it to see if I thought it might be something the kids would be interested in.  Hmmm, seeing Santa light the tree?  Yea... they were game!   

So, on a whim, we went downtown, did a little window shopping, watched a few musical groups perform and witnessed the lighting of the Christmas tree.  

It was a magical evening for everyone.  Scott and I thought it would be fun to grab some food at [Chic-N-Ruth's](http://www.chickandruths.com/) to commemorate the "anniversary."  Malted mint chocolate chip shakes for everyone!  

 As we sat around the table sipping our shakes and talking about the evening, I couldn't help but think how much had changed since that night 12 years ago.  12 years ago we didn't play peek-a-boo while waiting for our food to arrive...neither of us tried to lick the end [![IMG_0499](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0499-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0499.jpg)of table, we didn't sword fight with the knives, or share our bread with the little boy from the table behind us.  12 years ago as we shared first date jitters, we had no idea that we were at the beginning of the rest of our life.  No idea that the cute boy from school who was so nice, so gentlemanly, and so incredibly kind would grow to not only like me, but love me, and pledge his love for me till death do we part.  We didn't hold hands this time either.  (not many hands available when your pushing a double stroller through crowded city sidewalks and carrying an active toddler).  But, he has my heart.  Forever and ever.
