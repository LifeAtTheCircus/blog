If you’re anything like me, you don’t really need one more reason to enjoy carbs.&#160;&#160; Yet, I can’t help but share my favorite.&#160; One of my mom’s most highly requested recipes growing up was for her strawberry jam.&#160; She always got a kick out it when people asked her if she would please share it. 

So, here’s the family secret.

Yup, buy yourself a box of Sure Jell, add 4 cups of crushed berries, and 4 cups of sugar, and you are set!&#160;&#160; It really is as easy as pour and stir!

After berry picking with the kids last week, I was eager to stock up my freezer with our favorite jam.&#160; Unfortunately, we ate all of our labor, so instead I used a bag of frozen berries from the store.&#160; Truth be told, I think it tastes just as good.&#160;

Unlike Sure Jell, this one requires 1 and a half cup of sugar and the pectin doesn’t need to be heated.&#160; This is really my favorite part, as the kids are able to participate in each step.&#160; I will be honest though,&#160; it isn’t as good as Mom’s original.&#160; It is more soupy and tastes more like crushed berries on your toast, rather then true jam.&#160; This year I decided to make both kinds, so that the kids could participate in it AND I could have the good ol’ jam of my youth.&#160; 

 Even the youngest circus member contributed to the delicious spread!

Of course, there’s is something I didn’t tell you…only at the circus, would you find all three kiddos making jam in their undies at 3:00 in the afternoon!!&#160;

And since I’m sharing circus bloopers with you, why not throw in this pic as well?&#160; Whose daughter is that laying out on the table like a bikini model?&#160; (Notice my son’s hand in the bottom left corner?&#160; He grabbed his camera to take a pic and when he did **then** I&#160; noticed her mischief… After grabbing my camera, I then scolded her to get off the table)!
