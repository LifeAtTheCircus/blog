I love, LOVE picking fruit with the kiddos.&#160; Apple picking in the fall and strawberry picking in the spring are two of my favorite annual excursions with them.&#160; 

I was delighted when I found out that a family from our tutorial owns a pick your own blueberry patch.&#160; The younger three and I went Monday morning while my oldest was a day camp with the cub scouts.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

I hope to go back with all four of them and really stock up on some berries.&#160;
