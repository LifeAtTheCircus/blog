 Apparently my daughter’s [week long rebellion](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/21/were-ruining-her/) was against sleeping alone in her crib and not on sleeping in general.&#160; 

Tuesday was a break through day for us! 

She napped and slept through the night without screaming for hours first. 

As I said goodnight to her in her sister’s bed, she had the BIGGEST grin on her face.&#160; Seriously, I have never seen a kid so excited about sleeping in a bed.&#160; 

I did have to go in their twice because I heard them giggling and running around.&#160; One time I caught her sitting up “reading” on her bed.&#160; When I opened the door, she threw the book on the floor and laid down.&#160; 

Um, nice try missie, but you are busted!

Scott had to go back a third time and he threatened to make her go back to her crib if she did not stay in bed.&#160; 

We didn’t hear a peep from her the rest of the night!

When we went in to kiss them goodnight before we went to bed, we found her sleeping on her floor.&#160;

Naptime Wednesday also went well.&#160; Though she was disappointed not to have her brother and sister napping with her.&#160; (I have a strict, “keep them all separated at nap time” policy).&#160;&#160; She cried for a little while and then she fell asleep.&#160; (on the dog’s bed this time).&#160; I’ll be honest I didn’t care whose bed she was sleeping on, just happy she was sleeping.&#160; 

Tonight I had to go in only once to tell her to stay in bed.&#160; After that all three of them were asleep without a fuss.&#160; 

Apparently, she had decided she was done sleeping in her crib and she wanted in the room with her brother and sister.&#160; And apparently, this little girl of mine has a strong will, as she was relentless in proving her point that she did.not.want.to.be.in.her.crib!

I have been planning to move all three of them in a room together b/c I didn’t want the youngest to miss out on the bonding that takes place during the whispering after lights out.&#160; But, I had been planning to wait until we got bunk beds for the older two.&#160;&#160;&#160; Seems, we can’t wait that long.

Luckily my middle child LOVES to sleep on the floor.&#160; She did not bat an eye about giving up her bed for her little sister.&#160; I took the crib mattress from the crib and put it on the floor for my 3 year old.&#160; She is happily sleeping on it until we can find a bunk bed for them.

We still need to work on _waking up and leaving the room quietly so as to not wake the others in the room,_ as this morning one child woke crying which quickly led to three children screaming before one of us could get out of bed and into their room to quiet them down.&#160; 

But, all in all, it was the best night of sleep she and we&#160; have had since we’ve been home from Texas **last week**.&#160;
