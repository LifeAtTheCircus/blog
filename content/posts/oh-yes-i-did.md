Isn't she a cutie? I'm embarrassed to admit that twice in the last week I took my poor baby girl out in these shoes.  Yea... go ahead take a closer look incase you missed it at first.   Same style, but ummm different color.  The first was on a Sunday morning.  I was doing that mad dash for the door b/c we were already going to be late and I was literally just grabbing whatever shoe I could find with hopes that by the time I reached the door I'd have at least one match in my hand (and banking on that fact that if I didn't, the other half would be waiting in the van).  

Yea... no such luck.  

I absently stuck both shoes on her feet "just to get to the van"  with the plan of taking them off before I dropped her off in the nursery.  But, as I handed her over to the nursery worker, I looked down at her feet and realized I'd never taken care of that detail.  

ooops

Again.

So, when my poor daughter grows up with no sense of style or fashion, she can justifiably blame her mother.
