The Lord convicted me of something this morning at church and I had the urge to share it here on my blog, which is incredibly ironic when you read what it is I'm convicted about.&#160; 

Our pastor spoke to us about idols.&#160; He shared an idol that he frequently struggles with worshipping in place of God.&#160; See an idol doesn't have to be an object.&#160;&#160; It isn't necessarily a little gold man that you bow to.&#160; An idol is something that you put in place of God in your life.&#160; He asked the congregation what we are pouring our time, energy, and talent into.&#160; What are we worshipping with our life?&#160; He pointed out that often the idols in our life are in and of themselves not evil.&#160; An idol could be technology, tv, your family, a sport.&#160;&#160; The problem isn't typically with the activity or object, it is with our obsession with it.&#160; 

I knew instantly what my current idol is.

Yup, you're reading it. 

6 days a week I make sure to write something to post on my blog.&#160; I'll stay up late to finish my post or to enter my link on a carnival.&#160; I'll check my computer throughout the day to see if anyone commented.&#160; I'll spend time reading and commenting on others blogs, as I enjoy building relationships across the blogosphere.

None of these things are bad.

I don't think my blog is bad either (if I do say so myself).&#160; :-) 

But, I must confess that I don't have that same intensity or passion about spending time in the Word or in prayer.&#160; While I rarely go to bed without writing my post for the next day, I too often go to bed without even opening my Bible.&#160; 

This is not how it should be.&#160; The Lord Jesus is my Savior.&#160; I desire to follow Him with my life.&#160; I need to spend time in His Word daily in order for my relationship with Him to grow.&#160; If I wrote a post about once a week and never spent time reading or commenting on others blogs, I am guessing people would stop coming to read my blog.&#160; The relationships would obviously suffer.&#160; I'm so thankful that God doesn't abandon me even when I neglect to &quot;write&quot; but that's not the kind of relationship I want with Him.

I have a relationship with the Lord God because of Christ's sacrifice for me on the cross.&#160; I am able to commune with Him daily through prayer and through reading His Word, the Bible.&#160; But, by not doing these things faithfully, my relationship has grown stagnant.&#160; I want the passion back for spending time with Him.&#160; I want to learn new truths and apply them to my life.&#160; Therefore, I am eager to spend time with my friend once more.

I still plan to blog regularly (as evidenced by this post).&#160; But, I am going to try something out to see if it works for me.&#160; To help hold myself accountable, I am not going to post until I have spent time with my Lord first.&#160; This will allow me to make a statement to myself and to God, that I am putting Him first in my life.&#160;
