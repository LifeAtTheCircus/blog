 Each May the Blue Angels do an air show at the Naval Academy as part of the commencement week celebrations.&#160; It is practically a holiday around here.&#160;&#160; (If you donâ€™t believe me, check the sign out sheets that afternoon at the local schools).&#160; Scott actually saves half a vacation day each year so we can enjoy them as a family.
