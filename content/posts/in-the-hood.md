My daughter loves to change her clothes.&#160; We go through a clothing change at least, AT LEAST 4 times a day.&#160; Thankfully, she can dress herself and requires little assistance from me. Typically she rotates through her most favorite articles of clothing.&#160; In addition to [her candy pants](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/02/04/shes-got-the-look/), she’s added a silk pair of pj pants to her collection, as well as a too tight Winnie the Pooh pajama shirt.&#160; Her most favorite shirts though have two requirements.&#160;

A hood

and pockets

She loves, loves wearing a hood and putting her hands in her front pockets.&#160; We’ve got the red sweater number above as well as the purple Pooh sweatshirt and a lime green spring jacket. 

In my biased motherly opinion, I think she wears “the hood” well.&#160;&#160; The hooded sweatshirt is a look I don’t pull of nearly so well and typically save for cold camping mornings when I haven’t had a shower yet.&#160;
