We got to experience a real desert hike here.&#160; The sand on the dunes reach&#160; a temp of 120 degrees in the afternoon.&#160; We got a bit of a late start for a dune hike, but went on anyway.&#160; After all it was only 1/2 mile each way…

Scott chose a hike that he knew would have water so we could get relief from the heat.&#160;

Good call Dad. 

The kids LOVED playing in the wet sand.&#160; It was a welcome relief after the hike.&#160; And a great place to set up a “base camp” for the dunes.

Scott and I took turns running on the dunes with the big 3 while the other stayed with the little man as he happily rolled around in the wet sand to his hearts content.&#160; We discovered the best way to run on the dunes was in our socks… it was way too hot for bare feet.

Unfortunately, our oldest child wasn’t feeling well this day.&#160; Not sure if it was the altitude or a bit of dehydration from the hike the day before, but he had a rough time on this hike.&#160; Truthfully, it was a hard hike.&#160; It was in the sand.&#160; In the heat.&#160; In the elevation.&#160; That walk back at 1pm was hard core.

But,the rest of us felt it was worth it to run on the dunes and splash in the water.&#160;

We refueled and refreshed ourselves afterwards with lunch at a nearby diner.&#160; We then set out to find showers!
