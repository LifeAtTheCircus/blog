We lost power at about 4pm on Wednesday. Losing power really wouldn't be so bad if it didn’t mean that I had to loose water too. It makes you realize how often you run to the sink to clean up messes the kids leave in their wake. the kids have been handling it really well. I told my son that the electricity was out and about a hour later the following discussion took place.  

Son: "Mom, I can stick my finger in here now!’  (He's pointing at an electrical socket)  

Mom: "NO! son, you can never stick your finger in there. That is very dangerous."  

Son: "But mom, you said the electricity was out so there's no electricity in the wall - right?"  

Wow. I tell you. For being 4 years old that kid is smart enough to get himself in a bunch of trouble someday. Wish me luck.
