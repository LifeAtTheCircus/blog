With temperatures in the nineties this weekend and heat indexes in the hundreds, I’d swear we were celebrating the 4th of July this weekend rather than Memorial Day.&#160; We seemed to have gone from winter to summer, with very little spring in between.&#160;&#160;&#160; Wasn’t it just a few short weeks ago we were bundled up at baseball practice in our coats and hats?&#160; [![IMG_1387](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_1387.jpg "IMG_1387")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_1387.jpg)

The kids don’t seem to mind a bit.&#160; This weekend was so refreshing.&#160; We went for a walk/bike ride, we went to the park, we took a little hike, we had a cook out with friends, we went swimming and this morning at 9:30 am the kids were already in their suits and running through the sprinkler!&#160;

Others of us are a bit more hesitant when comes to being sprayed in the face…

Popsicles have been promised for this afternoon after quiet time.&#160; What are some of your kids favorite summer time activities?
