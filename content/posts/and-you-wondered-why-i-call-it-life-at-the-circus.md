Sometimes a mother’s ability to multitask isn’t a good thing… as I attempt to juggle one to many balls, I find that I can accidentally drop one and not even realize it for several hours. 

Last week while I was talking on the phone and cleaning up the living room, I noticed the kids sitting on the floor with some stuffed animals and scissors. 

I keenly observed that something looked amiss, so I grabbed the scissors from my sons hands, quickly told him that they needed to be used only at the table, and went to the other room.&#160; I noted that my son gave me a guilty look and made a mental note to have a chat with him later.&#160; I figured he had cut his stuffed animals hair and wanted to make sure I reminded him that scissors were for paper only. 

Phone call over, another argument between children settled, and a few messes cleaned up, and it was suddenly time for lunch and naps.&#160; Before I knew it the kids were down for naps and I taking advantage of the peace and quiet.

All too quickly that was over and I was snuggling with my middle child when I looked over on the floor and noticed a pile of hair.

Red flags quickly went off as I realized that was the same spot I had confiscated the scissors from hours earlier.“Please be cabbage patch hair, please be cabbage patch hair” I inwardly pleaded.&#160;&#160; 

It wasn’t.

What on earth would make my five year old think that it was ok to cut his little sister’s hair?&#160;
