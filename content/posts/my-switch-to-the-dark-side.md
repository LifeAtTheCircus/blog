It began innocently enough.&#160; It kind of drew me in with its rich, sweet aroma.&#160; For years I’d enjoy the hint of the flavor… in mud pies or Frappuccino's…even an occasional cappuccino.&#160; But I wasn’t quite ready to sell out and drink a cup of joe for breakfast on a regular occasion.&#160; 

Then I went to our annual Labor Day getaway.&#160; Which, in addition to being a house full of my closest life long friends and their chillin’, was also a house full of serious coffee drinkers.&#160;&#160;&#160; They were brewin it all the time and offering it to any interested.&#160; 

So I tried it.&#160; 

(With milk and sugar)

And&#160; liked it, a lot.&#160; 

They made more, I drank more and by the time I was home and back to life, I found myself longing for that warm sweet cup of love.

I think the big reason why I switched was because I recently gave up Coke and Sweet Tea.&#160;&#160; I am not swearing off of it or anything.&#160; I still have it on occasion, but I am not drinking it with the regularity that I once was, b/c I am cutting back on my caloric intake.&#160; (read… trying to fit back into my skinny jeans)

Coffee feels like a desert.&#160; It’s warm and sweet and filling and you can sip it for hours.&#160; (YET, with 3/4 tbs sugar and a dash of skim milk, it only costs me one point on WW).&#160; 

I feel like drinking coffee adds a touch of relaxation and luxury to my morning.&#160; It’s like a big treat for mommy.&#160; I get to hold a warm mug and sip as I teach school.&#160; Or bring it to go and sip on our way out the door.&#160; Some afternoons as I head out the door to gymnastics or soccer practice, I’ll bring a cup of iced coffee.&#160; It’s a refreshing treat with much less fat than a Frappuccino.&#160; 

I also love that Scott makes it for me.&#160; I don’t know that he will always do this, but for the past 2 weeks he has set up the coffee maker and most mornings even pours me a cup.&#160; (He doesn’t even drink coffee, he does it all for me)… seriously, it’s like a bouquet of flowers every morning.. I feel so loved and cherished, by this simple act each day.&#160; Our mornings are rushed as I to try make breakfasts, fix lunches, over see wardrobes (no you may not wear that flowered shirt with the polka dot skirt… please go change again), nurse the baby, dress myself… and I barely have time to eat.&#160; I love when he just hands me a mug of coffee to sip in the midst of the chaos that is our morning.&#160; 

It makes my kitchen smell wonderfully each morning, makes me feel loved, tastes like a dessert yet easy on the waist, warms you up, it’s a lil taste of vacation in the midst of real life…. seriously, why has it taken me 31 years to get on board with this? 

Any other coffee drinkers out there?&#160; Tell me, what do you love about it?
