Scott, in honor of our anniversary this weekend, I compiled a list of 11 things I love about you. 

1.&#160; You’re a dreamer. 

2.&#160; Your not afraid to go for the crazy (take 4 kids on a 22 hour car ride to see a 2 minute rocket launch… sure thing…stop by Times Square for hot dogs on the way to CT for a wedding with 2 toddlers and a very pregnant wife, “I’m in!”) and thus, you’re a great memory maker.&#160; ![Smile](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wlEmoticon-smile.png)

3.&#160; I’ve never had to iron anything in our 11 years of marriage. 

4. You put your family first… always…

5.&#160; When I announce “breakfast for dinner”&#160; you react with the same enthusiasm as if I am serving you filet mignon. 

6.&#160; You can fix pretty much any computer or technical problem.&#160; 

7.&#160; Your logical (and thus, a little of your logic has rubbed off on me over the past 11 years).&#160; 

8. You make up silly songs and sing them with reckless abandon to the kids and I.&#160; 

9.&#160; You always see the best in everyone and give everyone the benefit of the doubt. 

10.&#160; You have a great laugh, and nothing brings it out better than an old episode of AFV.&#160; 

11.&#160; You asked _
me
_ to be your wife.&#160;&#160; And 11 years, 4 kids, and a loud and messy minivan which serves as a taxi cab, later, you still make me feel like a&#160; million bucks!&#160; (_how do you do that?_)
