While planning our trip, I was searching for some sort of fun diversion for our long car ride day.&#160; I wanted something free, fun, and not out of the way.

Cadillac Ranch fit the bill perfectly.&#160;

Cadillac Ranch is a wide open field on the side of route 40 with 10 old cadillacs stuck in the ground.&#160; People can come and spray paint on them.&#160; It’s a “changing art exhibit”&#160; as people are continually coming and adding to and changing it.&#160; We actually witnessed that while we were there.&#160; Scott had spray painted a smiley face on a car and then went to help another kid with spray painting a different car.&#160; In that short period of time, someone had already painted over his smiley face.&#160; With all the graphiti, there is no way to know what was just painted and what had been there for hours or days. 

I packed some partially used spray paint cans and we let the kids go to town.

Our little “thug” in the making.[![IMG_0539](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0539.jpg "IMG_0539")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0539.jpg)

Like his smiley face?[![IMG_0587](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0587.jpg "IMG_0587")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0587.jpg)

Mom and Dad got in on the fun too.

We ended up staying at Cadillac Ranch longer than I anticipated.&#160; But, the kids enjoyed “spray painting race cars.”&#160; And how many times will I give my kids a can of spray paint and let them paint a car?&#160; I’m thinking it was a once in a life time opportunity.
