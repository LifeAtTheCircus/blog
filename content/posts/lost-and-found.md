Remember my confession back in May about [my hefty library charge](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/05/18/confessions-of-a-circus-mom/)?&#160; 

I am happy to report that I’ve actually gotten much better about returning library books since then.&#160; And no, it’s not because I’ve stopped going to the library.&#160; Sure, I’ve paid an occasional fee here or there, but nothing close to the **$42.09** I paid back in May.&#160;&#160; Perhaps they won’t be naming the local branch after the circus family after all.&#160;&#160; 

Today we had the carpets cleaned by Stanley Steamers… b/c it may sound like the circus here on a daily basis, but I was sick of it looking like the inside of a circus tent.&#160; When the cleaners moved my couch, you’ll never believe what they found?

The missing library books!!!&#160; 

I was fairly certain they were gone for good, especially when they never showed up even after the [crazy cleaning frenzy](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/08/05/will-the-real-crystal-please-stand-up/) I went on all summer long.&#160;&#160; But there they were, all along, under the couch.&#160; I am fairly certain I won’t be able to get my refund now, since I have no idea where that receipt is from mid May.&#160;&#160; So, it looks like we now own 2 Clifford books.&#160; At least we finally get to enjoy the books I paid an arm and a leg for 6 months ago.
