Sooooo much life has been happenin’ round here these past few weeks, I honestly don’t know where or how to start with chronicling it all.&#160; But, lest he get ANY older, I thought I’d pause in the midst of unpacking to comment on the birthday of my youngest.&#160;&#160; 

Because folks, sometime in the midst of packing, remodeling, moving, and unpacking… this little guy turned 2!!&#160; 

But, more than that, just like I feared, the little man grew up when we moved to the new house.&#160; Not only does he not need baby gates, he can be on a completely different floor than I am, happily playing.&#160; Or he can wonder around in the big back yard all by himself.&#160; We didn’t put his crib back together, as he sleeps on a toddler bed now.&#160;&#160; And while he is by NO MEANS potty training, he has gone on the potty a few times and even told me when his diaper is dirty.&#160; 

Which means, he is a full fledge toddler!!!&#160;

And while he works very hard at keeping up with the big kids, he’s also developed some of his own likes and interests which are all his own.&#160; 

Such as choo-choo trains.&#160; 

When we moved to the new house, we brought out our oldest son’s old train table with the tracks and trains.&#160; He is GIDDY about it!&#160; He happily exclaims “choo choo twain” over an over and I do believe he thinks the table came with the house b/c whenever we give someone a tour of the home, he eagerly brings them to his table in the family room.&#160;&#160;&#160; We showed him Thomas the train on Netflix and the loud squeals of delight each time he sees a choo choo train on the tv make all of us smile.&#160; 

And bugs. 

He is totally into bugs these days.&#160; Every time he sees an ant he’ll drop down on his belly study it for a few minutes, call out for us to come look, and then squish it.&#160; He’ll pick up any and every bug he finds and eagerly bring it over to us.&#160;&#160; Lately, I’ve been presented with quite an exciting group of squished invertebrates… spiders, lightning bugs, a wasp, ants, rolly pollys… 

Oh, and let’s not forget dogs. 

He loves dogs, the bigger, the louder, the better.&#160; He screams out “dawg”&#160; “dawg” over and over anytime we see one and loves to give them a huge bear hug and put his head down on their back to snuggle.&#160; He knows no fear when it comes to dogs (which of course has this Momma totally freaked).&#160; So the big German Shepherds behind the fields at his brothers baseball games, whose barks make all the older kids take a step back, they make him squeal with glee and I have to hold him back lest he run right over and stick his face out for them to lick.&#160;&#160; He loves, LOVES,&#160; doggie kisses on his face.

While none of my kids are what I’d call shy, he is by far my most extroverted child.&#160; He will joyfully call out hi to whomever he sees when out and about.&#160;&#160; He makes friends quite easily and has charmed his way into the hearts of several other gymnastics moms in the waiting room this past year.&#160; He even has his favorites whom he’ll go over to and climb up on their laps.&#160; 

He has the most precious lip pout and “my world is totally ruined” face when we tell him he can’t have something he wants.&#160; It is totally precious and I have to bite my lip and turn my head so I don’t laugh at his misery (and vain attempts at getting his own way).&#160; I am still delightfully surprised and relieved that he’s not a strong willed child.&#160; When I have to put my foot down and strap him in the seat at the grocery store or the dinner table and he puts on a huge tantrum, I still brace myself for a full fledge battle (as I endured with his older more strong willed sisters) and I have to laugh when after about a minute of screaming and crying, he stops and concedes.&#160; 

I love his little blond curls, his big blue eyes, and his smile that lights up a room.&#160; I love that when I ask for a kiss he sticks his cheek right up to me for me to give him a kiss.&#160; I love when he spontaneously tries to kiss me which means he grabs my face in his hands and licks me while making a puckering noise.&#160; I love the way he asks for Daddy or his brother or sisters when they aren’t home.&#160; Over and over… I love the way he sticks his fist up to us and says “boo-ya” when he wants to “pound it.”&#160; He is 27 pounds of pure boy and he’s wrapped his little finger all the way around my heart.&#160; I fear one of my biggest parenting challenges is going to be not spoiling him rotten and babying him forever.&#160; [![cake (1)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/cake-1.jpg "cake (1)")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/cake-1.jpg)

Happy Birthday Little Man!&#160; I know you’re a full fledge toddler now, but don’t forget that&#160; “_I'll love you forever_, _I'll like you for always_, _As long as I'm living my baby you'll be.”_
