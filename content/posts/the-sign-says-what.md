This picture cracks me up every time it pops onto our screen saver.&#160; Not only do I look incredibly tired and less than thrilled to have my picture taken, but in the background you see Potty= Privacy.&#160; What gives, you ask?&#160; Why was this dry erase board in your living room for 3 weeks?

Allow me to shed a little light to the back drop of this picture…

Scott took a week off from work after our son was born.&#160;&#160; After about 2 days at being home, he noticed I got a bit edgy during nursing time.&#160; I found myself almost claustrophobic and just begging for space…meanwhile the kids saw nothing wrong with coming over and kissing their baby brother _while I was feeding him_.

So, one afternoon he brought the dry eraser board up from the school room and sat the kids down.&#160; The kids were quite curious and sat down in a row completely quiet waiting to see what he was up to.&#160; He then made a rule list with 3 rules for the kids to follow to help Mommy and the new baby.

Rule 1.&#160; Potty= privacy

Rule 2.&#160; When Mommy is feeding the baby, she needs space.&#160; He drew a picture of mommy on one side with a blanket and lil feet sticking out and on the other side you see the three kids (far from nursing Mom) bringing her a drink or diaper. 

Rule 3.&#160; No rough housing/fighting around the baby.&#160; or ever.

I wish I had a picture of the sign.&#160; I guess something about having just birthed a baby and adjusting to round the clock feedings, left me a bit off my blogging mojo.&#160; I kept meaning to snap a picture, but sadly didn’t get to it before it got horribly smudged and eventually erased.

I loved this sign.&#160; 

It worked amazingly.&#160; I was never walked in on in the bathroom again.&#160; That fact alone is truly a miracle in itself.

Every time they crowded me while nursing all I had to do was say, “What’s the rule?”&#160; My youngest daughter would chant in a sing songy voice, “Rule Number 2… Give Mommy space when she’s feeding the baby.” 

I’ll add the dry erase list as just one more reason my husband totally rocks.
