The week has been full of shopping, cleaning, baking, laundry, card writing, visits with friends, and last minute preparations for the festivities at the end of the week.&#160; But, in the midst of all the hustle and bustle, I’ve had a few precious moments which I want to quickly record lest I forget them in days gone by. 

Monday evening I took my 4 year old daughter shopping for her sister’s Christmas present.&#160; She has known for months what she wants to get her, it was simply a matter of carving out the time for the 2 of us to go and buy it.&#160; As we drove off, just the two of us, she was excitedly chattering in the back seat.

After parking the car, I grabbed her hand and we walked over the bridge from the parking garage and into the store.&#160; As I held her hand, joy surged through me.&#160; So often, I am grabbing hands for fear of them running away in the parking lot.&#160; Most of the time it is a quick command and I stick my hand out there for someone to latch onto as I juggle the baby carrier, the shopping bags, my purse, and the keys.&#160; It’s not really an intimate exchange, more of a mode of survival for keeping everyone close by and safe.&#160;&#160; And rarely in those moments do I savor it. 

But, as we walked, just the two of us, I didn’t really need to hold her hand.&#160; She wasn’t running off and my mind wasn’t scattered in dozens of directions.&#160; I reached for her hand, just because I wanted to hold it and as I held her hand in mine, I simply savored it.&#160; 

When did she get so big?&#160; How can it be she will turn 5 in 2 months?&#160; She’s not the toddle she was just yesterday.&#160; And before I know it, she won’t be holding my hand in the parking garage anymore.&#160; In fact, before I know it, _she’ll_ be driving the car in the parking lot. 

We waited in a rather long line, but it was just the two of us and neither were in a hurry for our time together to end.&#160; So we didn’t&#160; mind.&#160; She played with the items on display at the check out, laughing and smiling at how silly some of them were, and all the while I just kept savoring her.&#160; 

Oh, how I love this girl.&#160; She’s not one to really beg for your attention.&#160; In fact the spot light is not a place she genuinely enjoys being in.&#160; How long has it been since just the two of us went out together?&#160; 

The answer… too long.

Since we were both having so much fun, we decided to go to Target to pick up a few things before heading home.&#160; Since this wasn’t simply an errand, but rather a “date” we decided some Starbucks was in order as we began.&#160; She got a kid sized peppermint hot cocoa (did you know they make the kids hot cocoa at a cooler temperature?&#160; How fabulous is that? Oh Starbucks… you think of EVERYTHING) and I had my now standard grande pumpkin spice late w/ skim milk and no whip cream.&#160; (oh how I love walking up and knowing exactly what I want to order and how I want it).&#160; We grabbed our delightful red mugs of goodness, paused for Cheers, and paraded around Target drinks in hand, happy and go lucky.&#160; We grabbed some pjs for her brother, and a sippy cup for the baby, perused the toys for her cousin and then headed to the check out.&#160; All the while she kept commenting, “Mommy, I love you and I don’t want this date to end!”&#160; _I feel the same way dear girl, the same way._

Like all good things though, our evening did end.&#160; We got home and shortly after Scott arrived home from wrestling practice with the other 3.&#160; It was time for pjs, teeth brushing, Luke 2, fluoride, water, and lullabies.

However, that hour and a half of one on one time, was a true present in the midst of this chaotic life.&#160; And it served as a gentle reminder to stop and savor the ordinary.&#160;
