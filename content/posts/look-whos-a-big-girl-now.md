That’s right after her total regression back to diapers in August (after a completely embarrassing trip to the grocery store which involved my wiping pee up off of the floor--twice, the shopping cart, not to mention our groceries….I thought I would never leave the house with her in underwear again) but after Christmas we decided to give the ol potty train a&#160; try once more.&#160; My mom told her at Christmas it could be her New Years resolution.&#160; To which she replied in her sing songy voice, “resolution?&#160; I don’t have any resolutions!” 

She was ready this time.&#160; We’ve been accident free during the day for several weeks now and this week we took the plunge and starting putting her to bed in her underwear.&#160;&#160;

It’s official folks…after 5.5 years…the circus is diaper free (for 4 months anyway).
