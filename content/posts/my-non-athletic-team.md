I am not an athlete.&#160; Those of you blog readers who knew me in high school can vouch for me on this.&#160; My position on the HS sport team was bench warmer, my role, “team encourager.”&#160; 

When my recent [blog friend turned IRL friend](http://ahappyheart-rebecca.blogspot.com/) accompanied me this weekend to pick up my runners pack for the Pittsburgh Half Marathon and called me athletic, I almost laughed in her face.

Me athletic?

Just because I ran 13.1 miles yesterday, does not make me athletic.&#160; If you heard me whining all afternoon and saw my crazy/gimpy/80 year woman hobble today, you would understand that I am no athlete.

I started running a few years ago b/c I wanted to try to get in shape, lose some of that baby weight, and to feel good about myself.&#160; And while part of me dreams of being able to call myself “a runner” I don’t feel I have yet obtained that status.&#160; 

Runners run All.The.Time.&#160; As in up everyday at the butt crack of dawn running. 

I run in spurts.&#160; As in, “Oh no that race I signed up for is coming up soon, I better go running this week”.&#160; 

Last summer I was pretty good about sticking to my training guide.&#160; I had this goal of running with a local runners club by the end of the summer.&#160; I finally got to the point where I felt I could run with them and then chickened out b/c I didn’t know any of them and didn’t feel like a real runner.&#160; 

I am thinking about joining them this month (once I can walk again without wincing) and maybe, maybe after running with them for a few months, I will feel comfortable calling myself a runner.

 Scott hates running with a passion.&#160; He does not understand why anyone would want to run just for the sake of running.&#160; He would rather run to hit the racquet ball or catch the Frisbee or throw the football.&#160; He likes to run with a purpose. 

Not me. 

I do not like any added pressure of catching or throwing anything while I run, _thankyouverymuch_.&#160; Just let me put one foot in front of the other and count down the miles till my run is done.&#160; No added stunts or tricks please.&#160; No team mates counting on me to perform those added stunts.&#160; No pressure, pressure, pressure.&#160; 

Running is all about me.&#160; I set goals for myself and only I can achieve them.&#160; If I fail, I let down only myself.&#160; No team members involved.&#160; 

Or at least, so I thought.

But as I ran yesterday, I realized that I do in fact have a team.&#160; Without Scott and the kids willingly supporting me as I take my practice runs, and then coming out and cheering me on for the big race, I couldn’t do it.&#160; I am not in this alone.&#160; 

Yesterday as I ran alone in the cool, rainy weather I kept looking forward to the next point in the race when I knew I would see my husband, 3 kids, and my parents cheering for me.&#160; I literally counted down the miles till the next spot where I knew they’d be waiting.&#160; They spurred me on, gave me something to aim for, and helped me run a little faster.&#160; They were my team.&#160; I didn’t want to stop and walk because I wanted to make them proud.&#160; I wanted to finish strong for them.&#160;

I forgot to mention the other reason I run…I really like to get the free tee shirt!&#160; Shallow I know, but I do really love those race day shirts they give you even more so than the finishers medals.
