What is it about&#160; stick of butter that my children find so irresistible?&#160; Why is it when I have the forethought to set the butter out on the counter to soften, my children see it as invitation to squish it?&#160; 

[At least this time](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/09/16/would-you-like-that-bun-buttered/), they didn’t use their fingers and smear it all over the counters.

Thankfully, it wasn’t butter to be spread on bread, but instead I am hoping to bake some cookies this afternoon.&#160;
