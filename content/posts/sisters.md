 One of my favorite things about parenting, is watching my children interact with each other (_when they aren’t fighting that is_).&#160; It’s fascinating to me to see the differences in their bonds and relationships.&#160; One relationship which I have observed recently growing is that between my two girls.&#160;&#160;&#160;

With only 17 mths, and a few inches and pounds between them, they are in so many ways peers.&#160; They share much in common, and yet are so very different.&#160; It’s been my prayer since the beginning that as they grow, their bond of friendship grows only stronger.&#160;
