What is it about baby animals that pull at a Momm[![IMG_8895](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/img-8895-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/img-8895.jpg)y's heart and make a genuine Cruella Deville like myself yearn to take them home?  Seriously, I am not an animal person.  You won't catch me bending down to pet your dog, ever.  And yet I found myself asking my husband if we could bring a goat home because they were "so cute".   Really they were... a mere 4 weeks old...look at them!  Don't you want one too?  And the piglets... a mere two weeks old had me ooing and aahing.  Pigs!  But I felt much like Fern as I looked at their cute little pink bodies all huddled together.  

 As we drove home from from our trip to the petting farm today, I realized, that I am really just a big kid.   I was going on to my husband telling him all about my favorite parts of the morning.  I was so excited that I had goats eating from my hand and I got to hold a baby duckling!   I truly felt like I had just as much fun as my kids did.  And like a kid, those cute little, furry animals made me think, "Oh I want one."  forgetting about the extra work of cleaning, feeding, and taking care of them  As if this circus needs any more animals in it!

I know we went to the petting zoo for the kids and I am so glad that they had a good time, but between you and me,  I think it's entirely possible that Mommy enjoyed it more than they did.  And it's all because of those babies!
