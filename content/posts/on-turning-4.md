My youngest daughter turns 4 this week. I often joke that she was born trying to keep up with her sister and brother.&#160; It’s true though.&#160; She is always ahead of where she should be b/c she has never wanted to be left behind.&#160; As such, whenever her birthday rolls around I don’t have that typical, _“How can it have been 4 yrs already?”_&#160; feeling, more often we’re like, _“Really, your just now 4… seems like you’ve been 4 for awhile now.”_&#160; 

One thing is true… she’s growing up too fast for my liking.&#160; I have one more year left before she goes to school… and since we homeschool, going to school is thankfully only 2 days a week at the tutorial, but even still it marks a new stage of life.&#160; [![Ruth Likes Her Dress](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Ruth-Likes-Her-Dress.jpg "Ruth Likes Her Dress")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Ruth-Likes-Her-Dress.jpg)

I want to be intentional with this last year… with our 2 mornings a week of time together when she is the big kid setting the pace for the household.&#160; I learned so much about my older daughter when her brother went off to school.&#160; I got to see new traits come out and her relationship with her sister truly blossomed.&#160; I am eager to see the changes that develop when the dynamics change again this year.&#160;

And I want to savor her sweet voice… I think that is what I will miss most when she grows up… the sweet sing songy voice and the cute way she mispronounces things…

I am excited to celebrate my sweet 4 year old this weekend….tomorrow we’re having a few of her close friends over to pamper them like princesses and next week Scott and I are taking her on a birthday date for dinner and a visit to Build a Bear.&#160; I can’t wait to spend that special time with just us and her!&#160;
