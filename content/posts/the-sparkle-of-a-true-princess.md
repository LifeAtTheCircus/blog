“Momma, don’t we look beautiful?”

As I praised them for their lovely fashion choices and snapped picture upon picture of their dress up fun, it dawned on me that this was an opportunity to reinforce what true beauty is.&#160; 

_Ya know, I said.&#160; To be truly beautiful, you have to be kind and loving to others.&#160; In fact, you can be wearing the prettiest dress ever, but if you act mean and unkind to others, you aren’t beautiful.&#160;_ 

“Really, Mom?”

_AND… you can be wearing plain, normal clothes, but if your loving and kind in your heart, then you sparkle like a princess.&#160;_ 

I am not sure if the message sunk in or not, but I realized today, that it is a message I need to speak to them often.

**“Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight.” 1 Peter 3:3-4**

I want to start praying that my girls grow into truly beautiful ladies that sparkle from the inside out and that they may always be confident of their worth as daughters of the King.
