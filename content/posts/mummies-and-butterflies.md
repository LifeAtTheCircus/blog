Our tutorial had its Science/History night on Monday.&#160; As with any special event, it’s taken a few days to come up for air following all the pre event preparations….&#160; As I watched tired mother’s dragging ginormous projects into the gym on Monday morning, I realized this is one of the major reasons we’re at our tutorial.&#160;&#160; Science/History night gives them an opportunity to get up in front of a group of people and perform something.&#160; It gives them an opportunity to work on a project, complete it by a set deadline and display it for others.&#160;

It’s helpful for me too because often I have good intentions of doing fun hands on projects with them, but then Friday rolls around and even though we tend to have less work to accomplish that day, I don’t often utilize it for extra hands on projects.&#160;&#160; And these projects give me a great opportunity to watch their creativity and work habits come out.&#160; I won’t lie it was a HUGE exercise in patience on my part.&#160; I had to take many a deep breath and persevere through the process.&#160; 

But, persevere I did and we ended up with a butterfly poster completed by my kindergartener and a life size mummy created by my second grader.&#160; There were other projects they did as well, but these were the two major ones.&#160; (read these were the two responsible for the my new grey hairs)

I’m so proud of them both and so thankful for the opportunities we have our tutorial.&#160;
