Today I spent my "down time" working on some Christmas projects which needed to be finished so I could get them ordered and shipped.  Then, I went about figuring out our Christmas card and ordering them. 

Because, No... I have not mailed my Christmas cards.

And until 5 minutes ago, I hadn't even ordered them from [Winkflash](http://www.winkflash.com/default.asp) 

Which means I have yet to address them or write our Christmas letter.

Yea....I've got a lot of work ahead of me!

I did, however, get our fall decorations put away today and cranked up the Christmas tunes while putting out my Christmas decorations.  

All this to say, I don't have my [Fro' Me to You](http://www.wearethatfamily.com/2008/12/sled.html) post up yet...check back Thursday afternoon.  I hope to work on it during nap time.  :-)
