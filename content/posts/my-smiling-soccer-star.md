This weekend my daughter had her second soccer game and I am happy to report it went MUCH better than [her first](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/03/28/setting-the-bar/).&#160; No tears or pouting and lots of smiles and cute waves to Mom and Dad on the sidelines.&#160; She enthusiastically went after the ball and always cheerfully raised her hand to kick off or make the corner kick when they asked for volunteers.&#160;&#160; Like I said, a drastic improvement over [game one](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/03/28/setting-the-bar/).&#160;

What a joy it was to watch her smiling face as she ran after the ball on Sunday. [![IMG_7413](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_7413.jpg "IMG_7413")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_7413.jpg)

I think it is kinda funny to watch the kids in the background of this shot.&#160; I cropped them out for the above picture so you could see her action shot without distraction.&#160; But, I can’t help but show you the bigger picture as well, b/c it makes me chuckle. [![IMG_7413](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_74131.jpg "IMG_7413")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_74131.jpg) The kid from the yellow team looks totally dejected as she runs past with the ball (that’s my girl) and I love how her team mate appears to be summoning his super powers to propel her up the field.
