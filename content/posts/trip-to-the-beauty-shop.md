I’ve b[![the kiddos on Christmas Eve](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/thekiddosonChristmasEve.jpg "the kiddos on Christmas Eve")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/thekiddosonChristmasEve.jpg)een putting it off for far too long (as you can soon tell by my before picture).&#160; But today I decided that my poor girl was past due for a hair cut.&#160; We’ve cut her bangs, but nothing major since what I refer to as the “debacle of 07” when I took my sweet 22 mth old for a hair cut and returned with a sweet little girl sporting the bowl cut. _Honey, I am so sorry.&#160; I didn’t know what I was doing.&#160;_ 

Since then, I’ve stuck with my best friend for bang trims and avoiding cutting anything else.&#160; 

But, if I am totally honest with myself, she’s been looking a little ratty lately.&#160; And that didn’t seem fair to the cute girl hiding under all that hair.&#160; 

So we braved the local hair cutting salon and I am happy with the results.&#160; 

Take a look.

After:&#160; (being true to the girl that she is, she had to change her clothes upon arriving home, b/c what day would be complete without changing our clothes at least 2 or 3 times?)

Man, who knew that hiding behind all that hair, was a little girl, all grown up?&#160; She looks entirely too old for my liking…but I concede it was long overdue!
