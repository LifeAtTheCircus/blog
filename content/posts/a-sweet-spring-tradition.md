When my son was 3, I took him strawberry picking for the first time. It was a special Mommy/Son date prior to the birth of our third child.

The next year, we returned, but this time it was a family affair.

2009 brought us back to the same farm, this time with friends.

And [2010](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/05/17/spring-time-traditions/) found me once again at the fields pregnant, with many small children in tow.[![IMG_8079](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_8079.jpg "IMG_8079")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_8079.jpg)

This year we found ourselves returning to the farm for a somewhat spontaneous trip.&#160; I knew I wanted to go this spring.&#160; (it has, after all, become a tradition).&#160; But with rain forecasted and a busy week planned, I wasnâ€™t sure when.&#160; We woke to cloudy skies, but no rain and so I hurried the circus crew out the door before they even finished breakfast!&#160; We were home with our pickings before 10 am!!!

What about you?&#160; What are some of your family traditions?
