_“To think that we were just the lucky few        
And all along I never even knew” – Bebo Norman_

Growing up, I didn’t realize how truly blessed I was.&#160; In fact, I don’t think it was till I went away to college that I truly recognized how good I had it.&#160;&#160;&#160; I was blessed to grow up in a home with two parents who truly loved each other as well as my brother and I.&#160; And they taught me a lot about what a godly marriage looks like.&#160; 

Three lessons on marriage I learned from my parents. 

*        
_Divorce is not an option._&#160; The first time I can recall hearing the word divorce, I was in second grade.&#160; I vividly remember a boy in my class sitting with his head down on his desk and when I asked him what was wrong he told me his parents had gotten a divorce.&#160;&#160;&#160; Shortly after I recall my parents having an argument and I remember knocking on my parent’s door, tears in my eyes as I asked my mom if they were going to a get a divorce.&#160; She got down on her knees, looked in my eyes and said, “Crystal, divorce is not in our vocabulary.&#160; It is not an option for your Dad and I.&#160; We love each other and even though sometimes we’ll disagree and argue, we will never stop loving each other and we will never divorce.”&#160;&#160; It’s amazing the feeling of security that conversation gave to me.&#160; Over twenty years later and I can still vividly recall the details of our discussion.

_You must make your marriage a priority._&#160; Growing up my parents sacrificed a lot for my brother and I.&#160; They both worked hard to put us through Christian school.&#160; They attended all of our plays, concerts, and games.&#160; They chaperoned youth group trips and band trips.&#160; It was obvious that they loved and supported my brother and I.&#160; But, they also made it more than clear, that their marriage came first.&#160; They had regular date nights.&#160; They went on trips away without us.&#160; And there were times when my self absorbed teen self would think it a great injustice that they didn’t revolve their entire lives around us.&#160; Poor me had to stay home because my parents had a date.&#160; My mom told me that there would come a day when my brother and I would leave home and her and dad were married for a lifetime.&#160; As much as she loved us, she didn’t want to center her life on us and find herself married to a stranger when we left the nest.&#160;

_Love is a decision, not a feeling._&#160; In high school, I was a hopeless romantic.&#160; I loved those cheesy romantic comedies and dreamed of one day being swept off my feet.&#160; My mom would tell me often, that love is much, more than a feeling.&#160; She warned me there would be days, when I wouldn’t always feel in love, but love was a choice and you can choose love even when you don’t feel it.

_Happy Anniversary Mom and Dad!_
