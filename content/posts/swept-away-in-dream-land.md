Yesterday I stumbled across [this article](http://wondertime.go.com/parent-to-parent/article/a-familys-year-abroad.html) in Wonder Magazine. 

My husband and I have been doing lots of talking and planning regarding our family's future... Do we want a fourth child or are we content with three?  Do we want to send our son to public school next year or will we home school?  Do we start saving now so we have the option of sending the kids to private school for Middle or High School?  

So many questions, so many things to consider... lots of prayer and talking.

After reading [the article](http://wondertime.go.com/parent-to-parent/article/a-familys-year-abroad.html) I called my husband at work in the middle of the day and said, "How about we take the family on a trip around the world instead of sending them to private school?"  

And I was a bit serious.

I have gotten sucked in by this family's adventure.  Doesn't it sound incredible?  We could literally make the world our classroom.  

I found [the article](http://wondertime.go.com/parent-to-parent/article/a-familys-year-abroad.html) online and forwarded it to him at work.  I then stumbled across the family's [web site](http://armageddonpills.com/How_To.html) and "How To" guide and spent all of nap time reading and dreaming.  

This is a far fetched dream with many reasons why it would never work for us, yet I found myself saying, "Hmmm  could we save so that it could maybe, just maybe be a possibility to consider in the future?" And I imagined bicycling across Europe with the kids... visiting the great Wall of China.... swimming in the Mediterranean....Can't you just imagine the blogging fodder it would give me as the circus crew takes on the world?

And for a few hours anyway, I took a step back from the closer questions of "Do we want a fourth child?" and "How will we educate our son next year," and instead imagined carting literally across the world with our children in tow and experiencing together as a family this great big world our God made.  Because the world is a whole lot bigger than the U.S. of A.  

Now I am back to folding laundry, putting away fall decorations, and buying groceries.  We've got an appointment at the local elementary school next week to observe the kindergarten class and Scott and I still aren't sure if we want to increase the size of our circus crew.  But visions of international travel now dance in my head as well...
