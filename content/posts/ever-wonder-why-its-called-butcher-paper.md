I was an elementary school teacher for 3 years.&#160; We used butcher paper all the time for bulletin boards.&#160; I’ve also seen it cleverly used at restaurants in place of a tablecloth to give a space for the kids to doodle while waiting.&#160; Never… in all my years did I really stop to think why it was called butcher paper.. or what the actual intent of the paper was for.&#160; 

Scott and I got the idea to get the kids a roll of butcher paper to keep on our dining room table.&#160; The kids LOVE to draw and my girls are always scrounging around for paper or scrap paper to doodle/draw on.&#160; We thought why not keep a roll on our table for them to use?&#160; Sure beats having them write on my blank check book.&#160; 

I spent some time online looking up butcher paper, comparing prices, sizes… etc.&#160; And I had to laugh when I read this review on amazon for butcher paper.&#160;&#160; 
  > Finally a butcher paper worth writing a review about! I slaughter almost 2,600 cows a year and there's just nothing worse after a long day of slitting throats and yanking out entrails than to have your fresh meat crash to the saw dust covered floor because of substandard butcher paper. These guys know how to make butcher paper, the blood just slides right off! And it's easy to write on, too! I honor the memory of each cow I kill by writing his or her name on the wrapped meat parcels, and whether I use a crayon or a marker, I can be sure that name will stay on there until my customers throw the paper away.  

It just made me laugh not only b/c I never really thought about the other use for the paper… in fact, truthfully, I guess I thought it got the name b/c butchers used to use paper but_&#160;_ I didn’t think about the fact that butchers actually still use the paper.&#160; My favorite line was _“…there’s nothing worse after a long day of slitting throats and yanking out entrails…”_&#160; In my humble opinion, I think there could be nothing worse than a long day of slitting throats and yanking out entrails….ah what lovely imagery I’ll now get when my children sit doodling at the dining room table.&#160;
