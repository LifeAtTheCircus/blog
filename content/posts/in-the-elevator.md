There is something alluring, almost magical about the buttons on an elevator.&#160; My kids enthusiastically clamor for the opportunity to press the shiny buttons both outside and inside of the elevator.&#160; 

We have a routine when entering elevators which _typically_ works flawlessly.&#160; 

One child pushes the button on the outside.&#160; The second child then pushes the same button.&#160; 

Once inside they each get a turn pushing the button for the floor we want to go on.&#160; It’s a great opportunity to work on number recognition.&#160; 

And of course, the youngest can’t be left out in all this button pushing fun.

_Typically_ elevators are equipped with a little door under the buttons which has a little key lock thing.&#160; We tell her that is her button and she can push it.&#160; She’s happy, and we don’t have to worry about hitting the fire alarm or calling security.&#160; 

Most of the time

But all good plans have their flaws, don’t they?

Friday the kids and I were in Borders Bookstore.&#160;&#160; Because who doesn’t want to bring their three children to a store full of bookshelves and cd’s and other fun items to toss onto the floor?&#160; 

No worries though because this time I came prepared with the double stroller.&#160; 

Of course the double stroller also ensured the need to ride the elevator. 

We rode up, each kid taking their turns pushing the buttons, however this elevator didn’t come equipped with the decoy button.&#160;&#160; No problems though b/c my youngest found a nice black button with a phone on it to push.&#160; 

Of course I didn’t realize this until we were getting out of the elevator and I _maybe_ heard a speaker phone thing come on.&#160; 

_It wasn’t me_ who ignored that muffled voice b/c I was already half way out of the elevator and eager to get our errand over with.&#160; 

After wandering up and down each of the cd rows and coming up empty handed, we returned to the elevator.&#160; Probably 5-10 minutes after we left it.

As we entered the elevator I could hear that same muffled voice repeating, “Hello this is security is there a problem in the elevator?&#160; Hello, this is security is there a problem in the elevator?”

“Hello, I answered, we just entered the elevator, no one else is here, someone must have pushed the button earlier and left.” 

(No idea who that could have been…. **Not Me** or my circus crew)
