[Megan](http://www.mmdemontaigne.blogspot.com/) tagged me with this a little over a week ago, and I thought it was past time to play along.  So, in case you didn't learn enough about me on [my 100th post](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/17/my-100th-post/) ... here's more!!

_  


_1) What was I doing 10 years ago?_  
It was the summer after my freshman year of college.  My parents moved to PA so I was spending the summer with them and preparing to transfer from Towson University to Slippery Rock Univeristy.  My parents were in the process of building a new home so we were living in the basement while they were building the upstairs.  I had two summer jobs that year... I worked at a nursing home (one of the toughest and most rewarding jobs I've ever had) and I also worked as a waitress at a country club.  It was a tough summer.  My boyfriend (future hubby Scott) was in MD, I was in PA, and I had no friends in PA.  I pretty much just worked a ton to save for college.
  

_2) What are 5 things on my to-do list for today?_  
1.Help at VBS-- I have to leave the house by 8 am (with all 3 kids)  YIKES!  

2. I really, really need  to start on my scrapbook for my baby... her party is in 11 days and I keep putting it off... I think it just seems so big I don't know how to start.  

3. Run  

3. Do laundry  (You all know [how good I am](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/13/the-bane-of-my-existence/) at crossing that off my list)
