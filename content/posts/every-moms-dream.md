How many times have you wished you could be in more than one place at a time?&#160; I know there’s been many a time that I’ve had that thought….

And Saturday, I had my wish.&#160;&#160; We were in four places at once. 

The circus family stood in Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado at the same time.

We goofed around a bit and then the big kids got to strike their favorite pose in 4 states at once.

It was a fun stop on our way to Mesa Verde National Park.
