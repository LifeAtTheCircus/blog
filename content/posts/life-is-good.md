Years ago Aunt Karen gave our oldest child a Life is Good soccer shirt.&#160; Because the color and theme were gender neutral, I ended up passing it down to my daughter a few years later.&#160;&#160; It actually became that perfect shirt for younger siblings to wear to soccer games so she could feel like she was a part of the team too.&#160; By the time my third child wore it, it was worn with shin guards and sometimes even cleats TO WATCH the older 2 practice.&#160; Naturally, I had to hold onto it for child number 4 and he’s now old enough to sport it himself.&#160; It will def be one of those “sentimental clothes” I add to my box of clothing that for some reason or another I just can’t part with.&#160;
