I truly am in awe of George Lucas.&#160; Seriously, the man was a genius.&#160; 

My son is obsessed and I mean OBSESSED with Star Wars these days.&#160; Literally, every question out of his mouth has to do with Star Wars.&#160; When he watches the movies, I swear he is studying them… entranced by every detail.&#160; 

You think I am exaggerating, but I promise you, I am not.&#160; The boy eats drinks, sleeps Star Wars. 

And, he isn’t alone… there is a whole cult following of Star Wars junkies.

Which is what has me in awe.&#160; 

The movie first premiered over 30 years ago.&#160; 

30 years ago.

We are living in a whole new world, a world of cell phones, internet, google… 

and yet this very same movie is captivating the minds and imaginations of children to a near cult like following…

It’s not just like the movie is followed by guys who watched it as kids and&#160; enjoy reminiscing.&#160; Though it is, it is also followed by children who are watching it with fresh eyes and falling in love for themselves.

Which brings me back to my first point, George Lucas is a genius, and I am in awe.

The kids had a FABULOUS time posing with the various characters, and my son loved getting to pump them with detailed questions, while I was happy they got yet more mileage out of their [Halloween costumes](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/11/01/our-own-little-rebel-alliance/)!
