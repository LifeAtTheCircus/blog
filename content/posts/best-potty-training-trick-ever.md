 Trekking out and about about with a toddler can be tricky enough, but running errands with a potty training toddler, her 
into everything
 ever curious, little sister and her energetic older brother is down right difficult.  Those bathroom stalls were not meant for four people!  But what do you do when your potty training toddler has to go and hasn't learned how to hold it? 

This genius idea is courtesy of my dear friend Rebecca.  When I saw a porta potty in her minivan I instantly said, "I need one of those!"  

And let me tell me it's worth every penny.

I have a little potty seat in my minivan.  In the bag behind it I have the tube of mini M&amp;Ms (her potty reward) hand sanitizer, Lysol (for disinfecting the seat) and extra clothes (for times when we don't make it to the seat fast enough.  I recently added plastic shopping bags (for when she goes number 2).    Now, instead of dragging my 3 crew circus into the bathroom stall at every store on our errand run, I have her go before we go in.  (while her siblings are safely strapped into their seats (germ free).  At the [soccer field](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/11/10/fly-away-dear-boy-fly-away/) with no bathrooms?  No worries... she can go in the privacy of our van.  

Changing my minivan into an RV courtesy of a $10.00 potty seat, definitely [works for me](http://lifeatthecircus.com/category/works-for-me-wednesday/).  For more great tips, check out [Rocks in My Dryer.](http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/)
