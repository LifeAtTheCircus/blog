Recently I decided the entry way to our home needed a face lift.&#160; For the past 6 years I’ve had a narrow card table covered with a table cloth and some seasonal decor on the top.&#160; Sounds classy huh? 

Well last month I decided my table had to go.&#160; 

This left me with a bare white wall.&#160;

Nothing says “home sweet home” like a big empty wall of blah. 

So, Friday night my dear friend and I painted the town red.&#160; Or my entry “leather bond.”

I did a second coat on Saturday morning, but after further inspection, it’s been decided that it could use one more coat.&#160; I was going to put off the post until I could give you a photo without the lovely blue tape borders, but we’re not there yet.&#160;

I’m still not sure what to do with the space.&#160; I’ve thought of perhaps getting a bench to put in there.&#160; Though part of me likes the extra space as you come in the door and go up the stairs.&#160; Sometimes the circus crew needs space, ya know?&#160; And I am hesitant to give us something to deposit our junk on when we walk in the door.&#160; 

I’m toying with what to put on the wall.&#160; My current thought is to go with a [vinyl wall decor](http://stores.shop.ebay.com/Simply-Stick-It-Designs__W0QQ_armrsZ1).&#160; If I went this route, I don’t know what to choose….[something sappy](http://cgi.ebay.com/Vinyl-Lettering-Wall-Quotes-Words-Sticky-Letters-Art_W0QQitemZ110371864286QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item19b2acfede&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14), [a Bible verse](http://cgi.ebay.com/As-for-me-and-my-house-we-will-18x36-Vinyl-Lettering_W0QQitemZ130254724686QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item1e53c95e4e&amp;_trksid=p4634.c0.m14.l1262), [something silly](http://cgi.ebay.com/Vinyl-Lettering-Wall-Words-Quotes-Sticker-Dr-Seuss_W0QQitemZ220458038761QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item335452b5e9&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14), [our name](http://cgi.ebay.com/Vinyl-Lettering-Wall-Quotes-Words-Custom-Family-Name_W0QQitemZ250401615818QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item3a4d196fca&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14)… any thoughts?&#160; I’m stumped. 

I am open to something else entirely, so if you see this wall and have a bright idea, or any idea really, of something, 
cheap
&#160; inexpensive that would make it look homey, please share your thoughts.&#160;
