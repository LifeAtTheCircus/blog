Thursday we spent the day at Petrified Forest National Park, located in the painted desert of Arizona.

Here the kids worked hard to earn their Junior Ranger badges.&#160; We spent quite a bit of time learning and researching in the visitors center.

We also took a walk to look at the petrified wood.&#160;

We then drove through the Painted Desert.&#160; It was beautiful to see all the layers of colored dirt deposited.

We took two short walks to see some more petroglyphs.&#160;

On one walk we encountered this guy.

Isn’t he amazing?&#160; I’ve never seen anything like it… here he was just sitting on the edge of the walkway almost posing for a picture.&#160; He was the highlight of my day.&#160; Look at his vibrant colors and those long toes.&#160; 

It was a really fun day as we saw lots of neat and different things.&#160; We then drove to the Grand Canyon.&#160; We set up our tent by flashlight.&#160; Friday we will wake up and spend the day at the Grand Canyon.&#160; We will spend the entire day here and a second night of camping here as well before heading off for Mesa Verde National Park.
