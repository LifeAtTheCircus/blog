Saturday we left Nashville and continued further west.&#160; Our goal for the day was to reach Ft Smith, AR (on the border of AR and OK) and to visit Hot Springs National Park in Hot Springs, AR.&#160; 

Mission Accomplished

We were in the car from about 9:45am to 11:30pm… with the exception of 3 hours in Hot Springs.&#160; 

No one seemed to mind though.&#160; They had video games, movies, books, coloring pages, and crafts to pass the time.&#160;

We “dined” at the Golden Arches for lunch.&#160;

We read about Arkansas, the Mississippi River and Elvis Presley.&#160; We also listened to some Elvis on Spotify since we were going to be driving by Memphis.&#160;&#160; The kids were not impressed with The King.

Aunt Karen gave the kids each a little bag of activities for the car ride.&#160; They have been a BIG HIT.&#160;

We saw 3 skylines as we trekked across route 40. 

Nashville

We also passed several military convoys.

And hit some traffic due to construction.

Scott drove the entire way.&#160; Isn’t he a stud?

Today we will cross OK, the top part of TX, and enter NM.&#160; We will stay with friends for two nights in Albuquerque.&#160; Then we will slow way down on the miles per day and begin the camping portion of our journey.&#160;
