I love holidays… all holidays… as in Chinese New Year… Ground Hog Day… Mardi Gras…St Patty’s Day… Cinco De Mayo… give me a reason to make a themed meal and I’m in.&#160; I love celebrating life with my family. 

So, yes… I go a little crazy for Valentine’s Day… even if it is a holiday created by Hallmark…. I’ll still serve heart shaped food for every meal and dress my kids in red. 

Scott and I went out last night.&#160; He surprised me with flowers and a card and we went out for dinner and a movie, with Ben and Jerry’s when we got home.&#160; It was a delightful evening.&#160; I realized as I was getting ready last night that it was the 15th Valentine’s Day we’ve celebrated.&#160; I still vividly remember our first… when he held my hand for the very first time.&#160; 

Today we had heart shaped donuts for breakfast… heart shaped pizza for lunch, heart shaped sandwiches for dinner and heart shaped lollipops for dessert.&#160;&#160; We passed out Valentine’s at gymnastics and we all wore red.&#160;&#160; It was a fun day!

I love these kids and this picture just makes me smile… more than if it was a perfectly posted one.

And I could just eat these two up… I think the candid shots might be my favorites..

Can he just be Momma’s boy forever?

My heart is so full this Valentine’s Day… with love for my husband… who makes me feel loved and adored every day of the year…and love for each of my children…I can think of nothing sweeter than being his wife and their Momma.

Happy Valentine’s Day!
