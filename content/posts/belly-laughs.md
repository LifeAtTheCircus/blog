There are few sounds I cherish more than that of my oldests son’s belly laugh.&#160; You just can’t help but smile when something strikes him as truly funny because his laugh is infectious. 

Until recently nothing could bring out that laugh like [Tom and Jerry](http://youtu.be/o0CMoQf9B70) or [Snoopy](http://youtu.be/wL79E4PJ330).&#160; 

But, then I gave him his very first copy of [Mad Libs](http://www.amazon.com/Super-Silly-Mad-Libs-Junior/dp/0843107588/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307909924&amp;sr=8-2).&#160;&#160; And as I listened to him laugh out loud while he filled it in and read it to himself on the couch,&#160; well, I had to grab the camera and snap a few pictures.&#160;&#160; He couldn’t even read it out loud to me b/c he kept laughing so hard.&#160; I had no idea what he was saying, though I laughed right along with him.&#160;&#160; How could you not?

Look at that face… I know I can’t get away with saying this much longer, but seriously, is he cute or what?

This one is not staged at all, I swear to you, he put his hand over his mouth as he was laughing and reading it out loud.&#160;

I hope your day is filled with a nice long, belly laugh.&#160; There’s nothing quite like it!
