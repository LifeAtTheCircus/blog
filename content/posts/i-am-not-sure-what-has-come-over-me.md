Something strange must be in the air here at the circus,b/c this week I’ve been cleaning like I haven’t cleaned since I was nesting.&#160; Seriously, last night at 9:00 Scott came home from sailing to find me scrubbing the baseboards of our bathroom with a toothbrush.&#160; If he hadn’t heard the kids screaming for him from their bedroom, I am sure he’d have thought he went into the wrong house! 

I know I have been negligent on the blog front, but let me tell you on the home front I have scrubbed the walls and baseboards, cleaned the bathroom top to bottom (including the itty bitty corner behind the potty), washed the dog, stayed on top of laundry, cleaned and organized the toy room, cleaned (and dusted) my bedroom,&#160; gone grocery shopping, grated a zucchini, and baked some zucchini bread and muffins.&#160;&#160; Still on today’s to do list is to mop the entry way and kitchen floors, finish my dad’s father’s day gift (ya know since it’ll be August next week and all), order some pics to be printed to update my frames, and finish putting away laundry.&#160; Tonight we have a double date with some friends to see the new Transformers movie.&#160; Then tomorrow I just gotta scrub my sink and stove, clean off my counter top, and bake and decorate my daughter’s birthday cake… oh and buy the last minute food for her party on Sat.&#160; 

I am not sure the exact motivation for this deep clean, but I am taking full advantage of it while the mood is here.&#160; My son asked me yesterday why I cleaned the dog for his sister’s party and never for his birthday.&#160; I tried to explain that all this cleaning isn’t just b/c of her party.&#160; Her party is my deadline b/c I need self-induced deadlines.&#160; I have a whole list of stuff to accomplish in August so I can feel like my entire house is spic and span and organized so I can home school in the fall.&#160; Yea, b/c somewhere in the state requirements for homeschooling it says you must start the year with a clean and organized home…(note rare use of sarcasm by the circus mom)

Whatever the reason, I am happy with the result and hopeful we can maintain the new state of cleanliness here at the circus!&#160; (I’ve always been an optimist)!

_PS:&#160; Have no fear, for those of you that have missed my regularity in blogging and commenting, I have plans for getting back on top of that soon… already know what I want to write about for Fri and my [weekend thought](http://lifeatthecircus.com/category/weekend-thoughts/) for Saturday._&#160;_Incase you were wondering!_
