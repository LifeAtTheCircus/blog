Thanks to all of you that wrote with song suggestions last weekend to help me _Pump it Up_ as I ran 7 miles on Sunday.&#160; Some of you asked me to let you know which songs I picked so here goes...

*   Bootylicious-Destiny's Child (b/c when I run I think about looking good for my hubby )
*   Can't Get Next to You... Temptations (b/c KP you were right I love the oldies so I went with some Temptations, picked the song b/c I liked to imagine I was running soooo fast no one could get next to me... ha ha)
*   Unbelievable-EMF (You were right StellaG this song totally brought me back to middle school)
*   Getting Jiggy Wit It-- Will Smith ( b/c I really like Will Smith and it is just so fun)
*   MMMBop-Hanson Bros&#160; (again thanks to Stella for a trip down memory lane)
*   Straight Up-&#160; Paula Abdul (took KP's advice and went for an 80s--maybe it is early 90s not sure... tune I remember singing out loud in the old days... ya know before American Idol)  

&#160;

This wasn't the only music I download on my MP3 player though... my friend Megh had made me a mix CD for Christmas of fun, upbeat Christian songs... I took them and combined them with my 6 new tunes for a fabulous running soundtrack.

For anyone who cares, here's the lowdown on the run...

I left the house listening to Shine by Newsboys... so pumped... ready to run farther than I've ever gone before.. loving my music.... this was followed by Gettin Jiggy Wit It.&#160; It was all I could do to keep from raising my hands in the air and dancing while I was running.&#160; I am sure I looked like an idiot be bopping down the road.&#160;&#160; Next up was &quot;Tell the World that Jesus Lives&quot; (not sure what the title is really or who sings it but it was great)&#160; then a little DC Talk... Lean on Me... man I was having a really hard time not dancing to this blast from the past.&#160; Anyway, I was loving life dancing and praising and running along until...

&#160;

The Day The Music Died

&#160;

No, &quot;Bye, Bye Miss American Pie&quot; was not one of my downloaded songs... my batteries died on my MP3 Player at about mile 3.&#160; I was so bummed.&#160; But like Forest, I kept on running.&#160;&#160; Much less enthusiastically though.&#160; Every now and then I'd try again incase miraculously my batteries started to work.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

At around 4 miles I spotted my minivan and heard my husband and kiddos screaming, &quot;Go Mama&quot;&#160;&#160; Scott handed me some water out the window and said to just throw the cup in the grass, he'd get it.&#160;&#160;&#160; He then passed me a few minutes later and said to look for water at the school.&#160;&#160; Sure enough when I got to the school they were there again.&#160; I was so thrilled.&#160; I grabbed some water, threw him my MP3 player and my map (I had printed off a map of my route so I'd know where to go, but by this point I was back in familiar territory with less than 2 miles left to go)&#160; 

I figured this was it, but as I made it to my 6th mile they were there waiting again with water and a little note of encouragement attached to it.&#160; (He totally scored points for speaking in both my and his [love language](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/02/weekend-thoughts-the-best-book-i-never-read/))!

As they passed me on their way back to the car hubby yelled out the window, &quot;You've now gone farther than you've ever gone before!&quot;&#160; (see Stella G's birthday gift from her hubby [here](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/2008/07/weekend-note-md.html) to get the meaning behind this)

As if all this wasn't enough... as I walked on my cool down portion at the end there was a glass of cold water on the side of the road with a sign that said, &quot;For Crystal... please don't touch if not Crystal&quot;&#160; so I drank ice water on my cool down lap as I came home.&#160; When I walked in the door Scott and my older two kids were cheering and _Unbelievable_ was blaring on the stereo.

So I am asking, &quot;Do I have the greatest fan club in the world, or what?&quot;&#160; Seriously, I couldn't even begin to tackle this goal of mine if it weren't for my incredibly sweet and supportive hubby.&#160; I felt like I was on cloud nine after that run.

Course when I tried to snuggle up with my sweetie after the run to say thanks he told me, &quot;You reek!&#160; You have gotta take a shower!&quot;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Even still... I think he's the best.&#160; I've got 3 miles left to go.... August 24th is when I run the Annapolis 10 Mile.&#160; I think I can, I think I can....
