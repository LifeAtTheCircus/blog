The youngest circus member is thriving!&#160; At 2 and a half months he’s weighing around 15lbs.&#160; (my biggest baby yet).&#160; So far he is really easy going and super snuggly.&#160; A perfect combo for my youngest cast member.&#160;&#160; We’re on some what of a flexible schedule/routine, which is a huge praise, as we’re starting school next week with the older crew members!&#160;
