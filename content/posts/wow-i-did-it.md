Thanks to Becky and her [super fun WOW](http://everydaybecky.blogspot.com/2009/05/wow-results-ready-to-see-my-green-wall.html) (within one week) carnival, I managed to [tackle my overgrown flower beds](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/05/15/wow-have-i-gotta-lot-to-do/) and get them spruced up in time for summer.  I realize many of you did your spring planting early this spring, but I already told you yesterday, [I am not always timely](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/05/18/confessions-of-a-circus-mom/).  

Check out the before and after.  

Flower Bed #1:

I’d still like to cut my rose bushes down some, but I think you will agree it looks MUCH better than it did last week.

I grabbed our shepherd’s hook out of our shed and added a wind chime from our deck and a new hanging basket.  It’s my favorite part of the bed.

A close up of the plants.  I added some Impatients in between each of the hostas.  Impatients work well in shade which defines my front yard.  And it seemed an appropriate plant for the circus…_cause we needs lots of patience here!_

Note the watering can—my kids favorite part of the project!

Flowerbed #5:  The Garden

Despite [my lack of follow](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/04/harvesting-good-weeds/) through last year, I am going to try again with a small vegetable garden.  I purchased a tomato plant, 2 red pepper plants, some squash, zucchini, and some pumpkin seeds.  I got the garden weeded and a weed tarp laid down.  I didn’t get the vegetables planted yet.  I hope to tomorrow morning.  I am also hoping to tear out some day lilies (read get my husband to dig out the day lilies) in the side bed in front of the fence, to plant more vegetables if needed.  I am thinking about plating some lettuce seeds in a big flower pot to sit on my sidewalk.  I’d also like to plant some sunflower seeds along my fence.  

Check out the improvement (and my neighbor’s dog)!

I am really thankful to Becky for hosting this carnival.  Without it I am not sure I would have made the very concerted effort to tackle our flower beds (at least not in the last 5 days).  I am so happy with the curb appeal it has provided to our home.  And now that I’ve gotten started, I think I may have forgotten about [my not so green thumb](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/03/31/my-not-so-green-thumb/) and I am eager to tackle some veggies!
