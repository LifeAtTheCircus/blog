I recall seeing something on Facebook before I went to bed about possible flash freezing or snow.&#160; But, I didn’t give it much thought. 

When I woke up I peeked behind the curtain to see if anything came of it and I gasped.&#160; 

It was that big white puffy snow that sticks to the branches of trees.&#160; My most favorite kind of snowfall.&#160; And I laid in bed and watched it fall snuggling with my hubby and kids.&#160; 

Hello February 1st.&#160;

The kids ate a quick breakfast and made a bee line for their snow gear.&#160; Scott headed to work with promise of coming home for an early and long lunch and hopes of a sledding excursion.&#160; 

After an hour delay to our school day, I threw the kids winter clothes in the dryer, and we set out to tackle their least favorite and most time consuming subjects.&#160; (with promise of sledding dangling in front of them)

Scott came home 2 hours later and the sun was already putting a dent in the snow, but not in our fun.[![IMG_9094](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9094.jpg "IMG_9094")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9094.jpg)

Going back up the hill was much harder than coming down.

We were the only ones on the hill.&#160; I think this partly due to the fact that public schools did not get out or get a delay and partly because it was equal parts mud and snow on the hill this afternoon.

But, we were able to scout out some snow paths and a good time was had by all.

WIPE OUT!

We don’t often get out sledding and this was the first time I remember sledding in years… as in my entire adult life.&#160; (last time we took them to the hill I was preggo with baby number 4)

I had such a fun, fun time today.&#160; It was a totally unexpected, beautiful treat and surprise and a wonderful way to end the week!
