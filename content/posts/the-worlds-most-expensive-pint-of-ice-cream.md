Besides taking in the beautiful scenery (of which there was much) at Guadalupe and Big Bend National Parks, we really enjoyed being able to just be together ([most of the time](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/10/it-was-the-best-of-times-it-was-the-worst-of-times/)).&#160;&#160; Each day at Big Bend we took a very, long picnic lunch.&#160; One day we went to the western portion of the park and enjoyed a leisurely picnic.&#160; I thought it would be fun to [make our own ice cream](http://www.the-hip-homemaker.com/ice-cream.html) in coffee cans using a recipe I had found online.&#160; This was a lot of fun.&#160; I gotta admit it wasn’t all that cost effective since I first had to buy the cans of coffee, just for the cans, but we had a great time.&#160; (Yes, $9 in sunk costs right there… if I had been at home I am sure I could have gotten an empty can from a friend or something, but we had no spare room in our suitcases for empty coffee cans).

After enjoying our home made dessert, we saw a wild [javelina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peccary) across the way!
