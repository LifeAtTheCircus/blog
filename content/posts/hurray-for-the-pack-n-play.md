Today I found a way to help speed along that process.    Even though my kids have an entire toy room which they can play in, they begged me to let them play in the pack-n-play while I folded laundry.  Yes, that is correct, I actually said to my two and four year old, "If you fight or hit each other in there, you will have to come OUT of the pack-n-play."  

I didn't believe it at first either.  

But they played with their hammers and legos and I was able to fold, sort, and PUT AWAY 3 loads of laundry.  For an entire hour I was caught up laundry.. unable to do more because my washer and dryer were both running and 4 loads were waiting beside the washer.  

The Pack-n-Play, that's my   [Works for Me] (http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/)[Wednesday](http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/)... hope it works for you too!!
