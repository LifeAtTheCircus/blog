Few random thoughts to share with you, my dear readers… consider it some random musings or a brain dump, or catching up with an old friend you haven’t visited with for awhile, none the less, here’s my bulleted list of things which don’t quite make for a post on their own….

*I recently made the wonderful discovery of sharp Monterey Jack cheese.&#160; I’ve seen it mixed with cheddar in bags at the store, and knew you could put it in tacos or what not.&#160; But I accidentally bought a huge back of Monterey Jack thinking it was mozzarella.&#160; I used it in pepperoni bread and home made pizza. 

IT IS FABULOUS!&#160; 

Seriously, where have you been all my life Monterey Jack?&#160; 

Can I just say, best pizza ever??&#160; 

I think I may never use mozzarella again.&#160; 

* Cravings… been having lots of them lately… as in grilled cheese and relish sandwiches every day last week… and I polished off a big ol bag of Utz Honey Barbeque Potato Chips last week as well.&#160; I never, ever, buy potato chips…sure I might eat a handful at a party, but I am more of a chocolate chip cookie kind of girl, not a chip girl.&#160; Except for Doritos… every now and then I’ll get a hankering for Doritos… but never, chips.&#160; These chips were DECLIOUS and totally hit the spot.&#160; I’m already craving a second bag.

*Speaking of pregnancy…I’m officially in maternity clothes now.&#160; Couldn’t walk around anymore with my pants unbuttoned… had to go for the elastic band.&#160; 

*Confession:&#160; Those cheesy, sappy, kiss begins with Kay commercials, get me every time.&#160; Scott will roll his eyes and begin to say, “oh please,” and turn to see me with my hand literally over my heart saying, “awh.”&#160; I know, I am corn ball.&#160; But the one where the couple walks around retracing all the spots in their relationship… first kiss…first date…and the “spot where I said, “Yes.” uh….Can I just blame it on the hormones, please?

*Still reveling in the [sheer brilliance of my man](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/12/02/where-is-he-going-with-this/)… every day last week the kids greeted Scott when he came home with, “Dad, guess what veggie we’re having for dinner? We actually had 2 veggies for dinner on more than one night and served broccoli with our pizza on Friday.&#160; 

*[Aunt Karen](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/) and baby Eli, arrived in town this weekend… we couldn’t be more thrilled to have them local for a big chunk of time.
