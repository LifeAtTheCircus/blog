Last week was a busy week around my house...with [celebrating my birthday](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/17/princess-for-a-day/) and preparing for [my baby girl's first birthday](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/18/i-am-one-busy-mama-tonight/) party, I didn't have a lot of spare time left for reading the Internet.  So, of course when I checked CNN.com to scan the headlines, I only had time for one article.  Which article did this homebound mommy starved for information on life outside of the circus, click on?  

['It was like I was on Rollerblades,' says Miss USA](http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/15/miss.universe.ap/index.html)  

Yes, aren't you glad to know I take the time to read those articles that _really_ matter?  

For those of you that didn't take time for such pressing issues, she fell on stage during the Miss Universe competition.  

As I read the article, I couldn't help but think, "Who knew I had so much in common with Miss USA?Â  Never in a million years would I see myself in a beauty pageant.  However, if I was in one, I am fairly certain I'd leave a similar impression.   Think I'm exaggerating?  Too hard on myself?  

Reading about her moment in the spotlight instantly brought me back to a time when I was on stage in front of friends, family, and classmates...  

I tripped on stage at my High School graduation, after accepting my diploma.  I clearly remember the response of one of my classmates as I sat in my seat to straighten my hat and situate those cords you had to wear around your neck.  "That was classic, Crystal!"  And indeed it was... let's just say I am not one who is remembered for her poise and grace.  

That quick read last week in the middle of a day when I was busy cleaning house, washing puke off of myself and attempting to keep my sick son separated from his little sisters, totally made me smile... who knew this often clumsy, seldom dressed up, mommy of three shared something in common with Miss USA?
