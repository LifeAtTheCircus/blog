Those of you that have been visiting the circus for awhile know that I don’t use my kids names on the blogs.&#160; I once entertained the idea of pseudonyms but never came up with any I liked.&#160; So I’ve pretty much stuck with “ my son,”&#160; “my 3 year old daughter” and “my baby” for the past year or so.&#160;&#160; So far, I have no real intentions to change that, but I did realize last week, that had this been “Life with The Peanuts Gang” or something more catchy, I’d have perfect pseudonyms to use.&#160; 

My baby seems to always, always have something on her face and or clothes.&#160; Typically it is remnants of our last meal, but it also quite often dirt or snot or a combo of the above.&#160; As she was coming inside from playing in the sandbox I remarked to her and the kids how much she reminded me of Pig Pen.&#160; 

See the resemblance?

This of course got me thinking about my other two. 

In my opinion, my son would have to go down as Linus.&#160; Just substitute the beloved blanket for his [baby](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/03/16/baby-im-yours/).&#160; I can totally see him getting up on stage and reciting Luke 2 when asked [what Christmas is all](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/20/thats-what-its-all-about/http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/20/thats-what-its-all-about/) about, can’t you?

Now, my middle child was a bit harder.&#160; My initial inclination was to go with Marcie b/c they both have glasses.&#160; I then was considering Sally b/c she seems to be the quintessential little sister.&#160; (“oh big brother!” )But after spending some time reading the bios of the peanuts gang on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanuts) (a blogger has to do her research, right?) I have decided that Peppermint Patty best suits my middle child.&#160; (though I think my daughter is way cuter). Besides the fact that Peppermint Patty is described as a tomboy, they also described her as having a “stubborn personality with a dare-devil twist”&#160; While her stubborn streak seems to have, thankfully, ended with age, there is no question that she is our fearless one!&#160; So, I guess Peppermint Patty it is then.

I love the peanuts gang.&#160; Their holiday specials are hands down my favorites and a must watch every season.&#160; Perhaps its the way he captured the personalities of children or maybe its just the way they dance with their noses pointed up the sky, I’m not sure.&#160; But I love em’, and I love my life with my own peanuts gang as well.
