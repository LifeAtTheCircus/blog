We took the kids and both sets of grandparents to a local parade.   The streets lined with children and American flags reminded me of something out of a movie.  It felt like home town America.   My favorite part is always when the Veteran's march past.  As I stand and clap and cheer, I can't hold in the tears of gratitude for these men and woman who deserve honor and recognition.   They sacrificed so much for our freedom.   I just hope they know how appreciated they are and they can hear the cheers and shouts of Thank You!Â   Later this afternoon we'll have a cookout with the whole family again and then go to watch the fireworks.  To us it's the fourth as it should be.  I know there are many families that today aren't together b/c one or more of their family members is serving our country.   To them and their families, I want to say Thank You.  We're cheering for you!!
