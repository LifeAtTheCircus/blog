It's Thursday again, which means I am once again using [pictures from my past](http://lifeatthecircus.com/category/me-to-you/) as blodding fodder for today.  

[![spring-97-21](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/spring-97-21-350x200.jpg "spring-97-21")] (https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/spring-97-21.jpg)  

Here is a picture of my hubby and I in the **spring of 1997** at an All Night Bowling event for my youth group.  Please take note of the shirt I am wearing.  

Two and a half years later here we are in **October of 1999** at a College Football game.  Notice I still have the same shirt.  No shame in that... someone can have the same shirt 3 years later, right?

Last night my sister in law, Karen was in town and she went shopping with me to help me find some things to update my wardrobe. I had a blast trying on new things and felt like I was on reality TV as I would come out of the dressing room and model outfits for her.  The night was a success as I came home with quite a few items. She suggested we go to my closet and find what clothes I already had that I could use with some of the new things.  I felt like I was on the show [What Not to Wear](http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/whatnottowear/whatnottowear.html) as I pulled multiple items out of my closet and said, &quot;I've had that since High School...&quot;   Take a look at the shirt I put in the donation pile.

Hmmm, **11 years later** , I think it is time to say goodbye to this one, don't you? (yes, it was still in the pile of cloths I wore)  

As I was scanning these pictures in, I noticed that Scott is wearing the same hat in both pictures.  Seriously, what are the odds?  We both are wearing the same clothes 2.5 years a part and happen to take pictures at both events?   This made me laugh.  We are quite the fashion trend setters aren't we?Â  (no, he does not still have the hat).
