The other night as we were driving home from out of town friends, our youngest complained that her belly didn’t feel good.&#160; A few minutes later I heard a cough and knew instantly what it meant.&#160; 

We pulled over and began clean up.&#160; For once I was thankful for our less than clean minivan as it provided numerous things for us to use as barf bags and clean up rags for the remaining hour drive home.&#160; 

Once home, we got her clothes in the wash and got the kiddos ready for bed.&#160; 

Scott and I began preparations with militaristic regime and efficiency.&#160;&#160; We instantly had the kids get all of their beloved stuffed animals and blankets off of their beds.&#160; Each kid was allowed to sleep with one blanket and their washable lovey.&#160; I wanted to limit the amount of laundry that would need done if the inevitable occurred. We convinced my son not to sleep on the top bunk.&#160; We gave each kid a bowl “just in case” and we braced ourselves for a long night ahead.&#160; 

My poor little girl was sick most of the night.&#160; She went from every 10 minutes to every 30.&#160; Finally at around 4:30 her misery seemed to end and I was able to go back to sleep for a few more hours, while Scott got ready to go to the airport for a day long business trip.&#160; 

Once the kids were awake, I took things slowly.&#160; I let my daughter drink water, but only sips in 10 minute increments.&#160; I’ve learned the hard way that if you let them gulp down too much water on an empty stomach, they only throw it all up again.&#160; 

I set a timer and each time it went off she was allowed to take another sip.&#160; After an hour or two of this, with her holding it down, I let her drink more. Once it seemed that she was able to keep down the water, and after much begging for food, I let her eat some toast and dry cereal. 

So far so good.

As for the others, I was pretty convinced they could fall at any time, so I did my best to prepare for it.&#160; I scrubbed down the bathroom and washed all the linens from the night before.&#160; I let them eat, but kept the menu bland and didn’t allow them to have dairy.&#160; 

The biggest risk with the stomach bug is dehydration.&#160; So, I did my best to keep the kids and I hydrated incase we&#160; were to fall next.&#160; I made a chart with each of our names on top.&#160; I told them we’d each get a sticker for every glass of water drunk that day.&#160; 

This worked perfectly for my competitively driven children.&#160; All it took was seeing their sibling get a sticker to induce the other child to quickly drink his or her glass.&#160; By day’s end my son had drank 6 glasses of water and my daughter had drank 5.&#160; 

This worked so well, I am thinking of having a water chart up every day to help remind us to stay hydrated!&#160; 

It’s been over 48 hrs since my daughter first showed signs of being sick.&#160; As I type this, Scott is working to put the car seat back together after we took it apart to wash the straps and liners.&#160; (What a royal pain those car seats are)!

Much to my great surprise, no one else has showed any signs of being sick.&#160; I am thinking if we wake tomorrow with an event free night, then we are in the clear.&#160; 

I don’t think any of our preparations prevented the rest of us from getting sick.&#160; Though we did wash our hangs after every time we touched her and kept the sanitizer close at hand.&#160; I was also very careful to keep my hands away from my face.

I do, think however, think that if we had gotten sick, our preparations would have proved useful.&#160; Being prepared [worked for me](http://www.wearethatfamily.com) this week.
