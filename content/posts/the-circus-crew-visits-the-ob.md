I typically schedule my OB appointments for first thing in the morning so that the kids can stay home with Scott.&#160; This time however, his work schedule didn’t cooperate, so I brought the circus crew with me for my check up.&#160;&#160; I knew at 28 weeks they wouldn’t be doing an exam, so I felt comfortable having them tag along.&#160; I did come prepared with coloring books, crayons, snacks, and even lollipops which I saved for the very end if they were “super stars.”&#160; 

First stop was of course the bathroom so I could “leave a sample.”&#160; So, in the 4 of us went.&#160; I thought peeing in a public bathroom with my crew was an invasion of privacy, but that holds nothing to peeing in a cup with 6 eyes staring at you.&#160; Thankfully the older two obeyed and faced the wall and just my youngest stared questioningly at me.&#160; 

Of course I was bombarded with questions as I did my business. 

“What are they going to do with your pee?”&#160; “How do they test it Mom?”&#160; “Why did you only pee a little?”&#160; and my favorite, “Hey, can I see the stick you peed on to find out you were having a baby?”&#160; (that would be my oldest, of course)

We filed out of the bathroom and then went to the nurses station where they checked my blood pressure and then I got to step on the scale.&#160; As I stepped up my son said, “I bet it’s going to say a lot, because your heavy!”&#160;&#160;&#160; (I knew there was a reason why I typically leave them home for these visits).&#160; All I could do was chuckle as the nurse told them you, “never, ever tell your Mommy she’s big!”&#160; They couldn’t figure out why in the world not.&#160; 

Having been the source of numerous smirks at this point, we headed back to the room to wait for the Dr.&#160; I knew I’d be having my glucose test done as well, so I also prepped them for the fact that they’d be taking some of Mommy’s blood to check and make sure Mommy and the baby were healthy.&#160; When the woman came in to take my blood, she had a captive audience.&#160; Crayons instantly fell to the floor as they gathered around with wide eyes and watched.&#160; I assured them that “it doesn’t hurt, and she won’t take much, but Mommy typically doesn’t like to watch while they do it, so I usually look away.”&#160; They of course didn’t want to miss a thing.&#160; And thus I got to receive the play by play of the blood draw process.&#160; “Why do they tie that thing on your arm?”&#160; “Will she give you a band aid?”&#160; “Will she put the blood back in when she’s done?”&#160; and “Look, Mom it’s coming out, she’s getting lots.”&#160; I reminded them of when Daddy gave blood at church, how he gave lots more and this was just a tiny bit and my body would make more, just like Daddy’s did.&#160; They then told the lady how Daddy gave a whole bag of blood when he gave blood.&#160;&#160; Suddenly my two little vials seemed unimpressive. 

Finally, we saw the doctor.&#160; The kids could now eat their beloved snacks (Trader Joes letter cookies) and we got to listen to the heart beat (my absolute favorite part).&#160; When I lifted my shirt there was a line on my skin from my pants.&#160; Of course, my son pointed this out and asked the Dr what it was.&#160; She told him my pants were probably a little tight and left a mark.&#160; _Thanks son for drawing attention, yet again to my size._

Thankfully, everything looked good and we were on our way.&#160; As we checked out (“Like at a store?”, “What are you buying mom?”) I was able to make my appointments for just about the remainder of my pregnancy.&#160; I scheduled all of them up until the week before my due date (they weren’t scheduling into that final week yet).&#160; I couldn’t believe it!&#160; We’re really rounding the mark and coming in for the final stretch!&#160; In fact, tomorrow is the first day of my third trimester!
