In college I had some friends who had wipe off boards and would write up some funny or amusing phrase they'd over hear and it would stay on the &quot;quote board&quot;&#160; until the next memorable statement.&#160; Anyone else do this? 

Well, I guess I am using this blog post as my quote board... here are a few memorable ones from the past several weeks.

While drinking some water one hot evening my son said to me, &quot;Mom, soon this is going to be pee!&quot;

&#160;

When my son was sick last week I told him not to get too close to his sisters so they wouldn't get his germs and get sick.&#160; When my middle child came over to him later in the day he told her, &quot;You have to stay away, I have germs.&quot;&#160; to which she responded in a whiny voice, &quot;I want germs... I WANT germs too!&quot;&#160;

I looked over at my baby girl yesterday afternoon to find her standing on the toy box.&#160; This was not safe (since she is just learning to walk) so I took her down and every time she tried to climb up I told her no.&#160; She'd look up at me and mutter some unintelligible babble.&#160; But it was the same unintelligible babble each time... I swear to you it sounded like she said, &quot;what's up with that?&quot;&#160; Her siblings were on the toy box (which they are now no longer allowed to do)&#160; and each time she went over to climb up, I'd say, &quot;No Baby&quot; to which she'd look up at me and mutter, &quot;whutzupitat&quot;
