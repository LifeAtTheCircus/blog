When my son started preschool last fall, I told him he’d have a chance to make some new friends.&#160; His response?&#160; “I don’t need new friends.&#160; I have enough friends already.”&#160; I then proceeded to explain that sometimes maybe they need us.&#160; It took a little while, but he warmed up and made some new friends at preschool. 

Hmmm… ever notice how sometimes you see something about yourself reflected in your child? 

How often to I close myself off?&#160; How often do I neglect to “put myself out there” and make new friends because I feel like I don’t need them?&#160; I am not naturally outgoing.&#160; Truth be told, I am more of an introvert.&#160; And I stink at small talk.&#160; So, really making new friends is not exactly my thing either.&#160; 

This fall, our family enrolled at a home school tutorial.&#160; I remember sitting at the orientation, where I knew not a soul, and feeling very much like my son did last fall.&#160; He adapted more easily than I did this year and made friends quite quickly.&#160; He was begging me to invite his friends over and I had yet to really introduce myself to any of the other moms. 

But, then we had our monthly parent meetings and I found myself sitting next to other kindergarten moms, several who had younger daughters as well.&#160; As our girls bonded over baby dolls under the pews, we engaged in small talk.&#160; A few months later, I was assigned my first big volunteer responsibility to cochair the Harvest Party for the tutorial.&#160; Turns out my partner was also new to the tutorial and her daughter sits next to my son in class.&#160; They were already good friends, having bonded over Star Wars at recess.&#160; Within one phone call, I felt a connection with her.&#160; We set up a play date to work on the specifics of the party.&#160; While our kids played together we sat and talked about relay games, food lists, and our husbands and kids.&#160; The next day we met for lunch at Chick-Fil-A. 

A connection was made and a friendship born.&#160; 

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about community.&#160; How do you develop a sense of community in your school, church, or other group? 

I really think, you do it by creating opportunities for people to work along side each other.&#160;&#160; Working together on a project, big or small, gives you a common ground and experience from which to build a relationship.&#160; Whether it be serving on a Vacation Bible School committee, setting tables up for a brunch, or working side by side on the PTA, I really think a sense of community is developed&#160; when people feel like they have something to contribute to the group and when they have the opportunity to work alongside other people for a common goal.&#160; Also, by working together, you instantly have a common ground, it helps fill that gap that just sitting around making small talk can leave.&#160; I am not suggesting you’re going to instantly become best friends with someone just because you work together on a project.&#160; But, I do think you can make a connection with someone.&#160; And as those connections are made and conversations started, friendships will grow.&#160; Besides building a community isn’t the necessarily about building an instant group of best friends.&#160; It’s about building a sense of belonging, making people feel welcome and needed, and a part of the team.&#160;&#160; I am sure there are other ways to build a community, but I do think that a community built on serving together, is one that I’d like to be a part of.&#160;&#160; What do you think?&#160; Any thoughts on how one can build a sense of community within their group?
