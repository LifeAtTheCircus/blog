A few weeks ago my son came up to me and asked if [Prince Charming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Charming) was always the prince.&#160; I told him yes.&#160; His eyes got really big and he said, “_Wow, that is a lot of princesses to take care of._”&#160; 

Apparently, he wasn’t done pondering the subject, because later while holding up his sister’s sippy cup, he remarked, “_That’s too many princesses for one guy… you’re only supposed to have one.”_

How right he is.&#160;
