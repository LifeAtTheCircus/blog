Many of you know, that my hubby and I are big Pittsburgh Steelers [fans](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/19/star-struck/).  Sadly, many of the games are not televised here.    We didn't want to miss the big opening game on Sunday, so we took the kids to [Glory Days](http://www.glorydaysgrill.com/) restaurant to watch the game.  

My hubby and I were a little nervous about how well this would go down.  How would we keep 3 kids entertained sitting at a restaurant table for 3 hours?

There are TV's all around the restaurant with speakers at each table.  You punch the number of the game you want to watch, and you can hear your game at your table.  Not only does this mean that we get to watch and hear our game, but it means the restaurant is loud... as in loud enough to cover the sounds of our 3 ring circus.

My son would proudly wave his terrible towel every time we got a touch down or he heard Mommy and Daddy screaming.  (Yes, we will def have to undo the damage we've done in teaching our kids restaurant manners).  

In between screaming at touchdowns, we kept the kids occupied with food.  In addition to the kids meals, we came with reinforcements of crackers and raisins.  

I also brought along some toys for them to play with at the table when they grew restless.

Play dough was a big hit with my 2 year old.

My littlest fan enjoyed playing with a toy truck.

And I printed off coloring sheets for the oldest two (went online and found football coloring sheets...even got to specify the [number 7](http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08253/910542-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml) for the quarterback I printed off)

Since we don't yet have [NFL Sunday Ticket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Sunday_Ticket), watching the big game at Glory Days worked for us.  Coming stocked with extra snacks and plenty of toys to occupy the kiddos, enabled us to actually watch the game while we were there.   The day was a big success in our book!  (Did I mention the [Steelers won 38-17](http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/08/sports/FBN-Texans-Steelers-Folo.php))?  Success, indeed!
