While we didn’t plan it like this at first, Sunday ended up being date day for each of our 4 kids.&#160;&#160; Each child ended up with some one on one time with either mom, dad, or Aunt Karen.&#160; Good times had by all!

One of the duties of our church deacons is to unlock the church on Sunday mornings.&#160; When Scott became a deacon 3 years ago, he started taking one child with him on his deacon duty mornings.&#160; This served a dual or maybe even triple purpose.&#160; 1.&#160; it got him some one on one time with one of the kids&#160; 2.[![daddy deacon date](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/daddy-deacon-date.jpg "daddy deacon date")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/daddy-deacon-date.jpg)&#160; it allowed the kids to participate in serving the church alongside him&#160; (rather than serving at church being something that took Daddy away from the fam) and 3.&#160; it left me with one left kid to get ready for church Sunday morning.&#160;&#160;&#160; The kids LOVE when it is their turn for deacon duty with Daddy.&#160; They love unlocking their SS classrooms, turning on the lights, and turning on the heat in each room.&#160; They also enjoy watching the worship team practice and probably most of all, they love having Daddy to themselves for a few hours on Sunday morning.&#160;&#160;&#160; This Sunday it was our 4 year olds turn and her face lit up when Daddy asked her on her date.&#160; (they also LOVE getting to ride in Daddy’s car and put the windows down!)

This Sunday after church Aunt Karen took our 6 year old out for a belated birthday[![aunt karen date](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/aunt-karen-date.jpg "aunt karen date")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/aunt-karen-date.jpg) date at the mall.&#160;&#160; They went to lunch, went shopping for a new pair of earrings, and even got some dessert afterwards.&#160; She was so excited the night before when Aunt Karen told her to wear something nice and they would go to the mall to pick out her birthday gift.&#160; I was so excited that they were able to have some one on one time together.&#160; I love that Aunt Karen wants to take an active role in my kids lives.&#160; 

Meanwhile…since we already had 2 cars at church, I took our oldest son out t[![starbucks cub scout date](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/starbucks-cub-scout-date.jpg "starbucks cub scout date")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/starbucks-cub-scout-date.jpg)o Starbucks for a Mother/Son Cub Scout date.&#160; He only had a few more requirements left to complete in order to earn his Wolf Badge.&#160; These involved discussing a few hypothetical situations and how he would and should respond in each scenario.&#160; I thought it might be more fun to complete the questions on a Starbucks date…things didn’t work out the evening I planned to go out with him and the banquet is next weekend, so Sunday afternoon was a must!&#160;&#160; After our trip to Starbucks, we visited the library to pick out some more books for him to read.&#160; A perfect afternoon date if you ask me! 

Every Sunday evening is Daddy date time for our you[![IMG_2098](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2098.jpg "IMG_2098")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2098.jpg)ngest.&#160; I take the older three to evening church for catechism class.&#160; Since I teach one of the classes, I stay there with them.&#160; This affords Scott some rare one on one time with the lil guy.&#160; Scott has always appreciated this time on Sunday evenings…. when I first started 4 years ago it was his Daddy/girl time while the oldest and I went to class.&#160; He really does treasure a few hours on Sunday evening to play with the youngest of the crew while everyone else is away.&#160; 

We don’t have a set schedule for who gets one on one time with whom when.&#160; It doesn’t happen on a set rotation each month.&#160; (other than keeping track of who is up next for deacon duty) But, when we can we try to seize the opportunity for a little one on one time with each kid… to see their personalities apart from the rest, to listen to just them, and to foster our relationships with them as individuals.&#160; This Sunday was a rare opportunity for each child to enjoy some time in the lime light.&#160;
