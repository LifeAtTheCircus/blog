I often don’t bother scrambling around the house looking for shoes before heading out the door.&#160; We give a good attempt, but if we’re running late, I bank on the fact that we’ll be able to find a pair in the van. 

One afternoon when my husband asked where to find my daughter’s shoe and I told him, these are what he found on the floor of our van (and believe it or not, there are more that just didn’t fit into the shot).

Yea..I’m busted…my days of being [held accountable](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/09/09/what-a-little-motivation-can-do/) by the preschool pick up line are over…looks like the circus is keeping it real at preschool too.
