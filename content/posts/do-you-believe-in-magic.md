I seriously wonder what moms did before the internet.&#160; Where did you go when you were looking for that cookie recipe you can’t find in your recipe box, or to check for tips on how to bring your child’s fever down, or to seek help tips for crayon removal?

A few weeks ago when I discovered this

after my daughter’s naptime, I left a face book status that I was wondering how to get marker off of a baby doll face and within the hour I had 15 helpful tips. 

But, it turned out this lovely mess was crayon and not marker.&#160; (when I asked her why she wrote on her doll with crayon her response was, “Because the crayon was there.”&#160; Niiiice!)

Have no fear, google is here!

Turns out 
you can get crayon off of plastic by using baby oil
. 

Check out the results.

A few weeks later I found this little note on the wall when I was preparing the guest room for company.&#160; I would have assumed it was my daughter again, because I KNOW my son knows better than to write on the wall.&#160; 

Thankfully, he preserved his sister from being falsely accused by leaving his name in our baseboard next to this message.&#160; I thought it looked like a cry for help.&#160; As in “(insert son’s name here) hello please help”

However, during my great inquisition I learned that he actually wrote his name (not featured here) followed by bed. 

Clearly, we need to work on both obedience and spelling here at the circus.

So, a quick note in face book and I learned that Mr. Clean Magic Eraser does the trick for crayon on wall.&#160; And indeed it did!

Google and Face book work for me when looking for some handy hints for the creations my children leave for me.&#160; Also, **Magic Eraser** and **Baby Oil** are new staples here at the circus.
