…she is fierce.” 

That William Shakespeare quote has always reminded me of my oldest daughter.&#160; She’s small in stature but strong in will and spirit. 

She turned 8 this week.&#160; 

I am proud of the girl she’s growing up to be.&#160; She’s not much like me.&#160; So many of her strengths are my weaknesses. 

She’s logical and practical.&#160; She tells things like it is and is a no nonsense kind of gal.&#160;&#160; She is self confident.&#160; She’s not a people pleaser.&#160;&#160; 

She loves, LOVES numbers.&#160; She loves checking the temperature and calculating the time and I am amazed at her brain.&#160; She just gets math in a way that I NEVER have.&#160; It’s her favorite subject.&#160; Doing math can take her out of a bad mood.&#160; It’s her favorite subject and always the one she does first on school at home days.&#160; If I let her she’d happily do page after page of math ALL DAY long… and willingly skip history and writing.&#160;&#160; She likes figuring out how and why things work. 

She sees the world as black and white.&#160; There is no grey, just right and wrong.&#160;&#160; She appreciates order and categories.&#160; She’s my left brain, type A child.

She also has a nurturing side to her.&#160; She still likes to play with dolls.&#160; Not Barbies or princesses, but baby dolls.&#160; She loves babies and toddlers and will take them under her wing and cuddle them.&#160; I’ve seen her do it with her cousin and with some toddler friends at church.&#160; It’s sweet to watch.

She’s a hard worker.&#160; She loves to exercise.&#160; She loves gymnastics.&#160; She loves working new skills and learning new techniques.&#160;&#160;&#160; I love the spark in her eye when she comes home and tells me she learned a new skill or got to work on a harder skill, like giants or back handsprings on beam. 

I love watching her grow and wonder what sort of woman she will grow up to be.&#160; What will God use her for?&#160; I could totally see her as an engineer, a coach, a surgeon, or a cop.&#160;&#160; For now she’s a second grader who loves building with Legos, crunching numbers, super heroes, and playing in the dirt.
