**Updated Below!


[Once we finally departed](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/08/15/all-packed-up-and-no-place-to-go/), the kids were ecstatic about our camping trip this weekend.&#160; As we were preparing to leave, my son already started talking about the very, important rules of camping, as he’s discovered them over the years. 

And the number one,&#160; most exciting rule is that **

camping is messy!

**

This one cracked me up, because while it is true, to hear him talk you would think he grew up in a house where he was never allowed to get dirty.&#160; You’d think his mom washed his face after every meal and dressed them in their Sunday finest before departing out the front door every morning.&#160; Yet, this child was raised at the circus, where bare feet and messy faces are the norm.

To prove my point, I submit to you the following photos and ask you to tell me which was taken while camping.

Exhibit A:
