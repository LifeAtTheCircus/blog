I’ve got pictures of all of my kids as babies snuggling up with our beloved dog… I’ve got the classic shots of them getting a big wet slobbery kiss while they giggle with glee.&#160; And Maggie lovingly observing their tummy time activities. 

But, of my four children, my youngest is by far the most captivated by our dog.&#160; [![IMG_9037](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_9037.jpg "IMG_9037")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_9037.jpg)

He truly loves her.&#160; He excitedly greets her when we come home.&#160; He persistently chases her around our house to give her big squeezes and to beg for wet kisses.&#160;&#160; Maggie is by far, the most patient dog I have ever seen.&#160; Hands down. 

Here he is watching a show on my phone under the school table, while snuggling with his best bud.

Recently, he’s decided that Maggie must need a blanket and pillow as she sleeps on the floor.&#160; (I love this picture… a boy, his dog, his weapons, and “his” Iphone….)

Here he is “tucking her in” with her blanket and pillow and kissing her goodnight.

See what I mean by patient? I am sure she is quite less than thrilled to be tucked in, but she takes it like a champ.

Until eventually she’s had enough and crawls away…only to be chased down “Oh no!&#160; She needs her pillow Mommy.”&#160; (I promise I intervened after this picture and let Maggie outside for a break from her naptime).

Maggie is getting old.&#160; And she has some nerve issues which are effecting the use of her back legs.&#160; She isn’t in pain, but truthfully, I am not sure how much time we have left with her.&#160;&#160; And as those of you who know me well can attest, I am not a dog (or animal) person… but I know that a better, more patient, more family friendly, more low maintenance dog could never be found and so in her final days/weeks/months… I am trying my best to be more patient and loving with her.&#160; Because you see, by stealing the heart of my son, she’s gone and stolen my heart as well.
