First I asked them to bring me a diaper so I could change the baby.  Next thing I knew every single diaper from both baskets under the changing table were in a huge pile in my living room floor.  After slowly putting one by one back in the basket and on to the change table, they were off to "go potty"  

When I looked in the bathroom every single magazine from our basket was in the bathtub, in addition to their shoes, clothes, and whatever else they could find.  I instructed them to get them out of the bathtub.  

They obeyed...  

I walked in to find my son holding a sopping wet magazine above the toilet and my daughter standing in the middle of a magazine strewn floor.  Since it was only 10:30 and the third catastrophic mess I came upon, I began to get an inkling of the kind of day I was in for.  

Once we got the bathroom cleaned up, they were off to go downstairs and play in the toy room.  They decided to invent a new game called, "junk"  They took toys out of the toy room and hid them in a pile under the table in my entry way.  I must tell you that this kept them occupied for almost half an hour.  They were happy and giggling and I was able to get some stuff done in the other room.  

Some days are just like that.  One step forward and two steps back.   If I didn't laugh about it and roll with it, I'd go crazy.  So, I do my best to find things in each day, each mess that can make me laugh.  I find joy in the journey.
