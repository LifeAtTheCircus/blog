Sometimes after reading the kids their bedtime Bible story we start to wonder, are they listening? Are they getting the point of the stories?  Every once and a while they offer up another reminder that they really are.  

Tonight after reading our children the story of Daniel and the Lions Den, my husband tried a little follow up to see if our 5 year old son was connecting…  
> Scott: “What if President Obama made a law that said that everyone had to bow down and pray to him?”

> _&lt;insert a brief discussion confirming for him that Obama wouldn't actually do that&gt;_

> Son:  I wouldn’t do it because that would be bad.

> Scott: Why would it be bad?

> Son: Because we should only pray to God.

> Scott: What if he said you would be thrown into den of hungry lions if you didn’t?  
> 
> Son:  Then God would save me.

> Scott:  But what if he didn’t save you?

> Son:  Then it would be time for me to go to heaven.  
Sometimes the faith of my son just completely blows me away.  I’ve read the account of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the book of Daniel several times.  

Daniel 3:16-18 _“Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. 
17
 If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king. 
18
 But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up."_  

That last verse has always gotten me.  They had such faith to be able to say that even if God did not save them, they would never bow to a false god.  

And tonight, my son said the same thing.  At 5 years old, he understands that God loves him, he knows he is a powerful God who can save him from anything.  But he also knows that God has saved him from his sins, and even if God doesn’t rescue him from his situation, it does not mean God doesn’t love him or isn’t protecting him.  Because God has already saved him.  

How blessed he is to know and grasp this at this point in his life.  I pray that as he grows, so will his faith.  

_**Awhile back, I tried posting a [weekend thought](http://lifeatthecircus.com/category/weekend-thoughts/) every weekend.  While m

**_I’ve taken a hiatus from this for awhile, but would like to start it back up.  Next weekend, I will open up Mr. Linky for anyone who would like to share a thoughtful post from their week.  You may either write a new post for the weekend or link up to a post you wrote during the week which you feel fits this theme.  It can be a devotional, a tribute, something on your heart recently…it doesn’t have to be about your faith, though mine typically are._ **
