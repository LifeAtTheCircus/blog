This afternoon my smiley, mild mannered, easy going _baby_ suddenly channeled his inner Dennis the Menace and went all toddler boy on me for 30 minutes.&#160; 

First I looked over and found him standing on his tool bench _(oops look who forgot to put away the advent calendar with her Christmas decorations)_

I got him down and shortly after realized things had been mighty quiet for awhile and went searching for him.&#160; Found him in the master bathroom STANDING on the toilet.&#160;

After shutting all the doors in the hallway we headed back out to the kitchen/living room.&#160; He attempted to get water from the fridge dispenser but thankfully it was locked.&#160;&#160; So, instead he opted for emptying my clean dishes from the dish washer into the dog bowl.&#160; [![IMG_1137](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_1137.jpg "IMG_1137")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_1137.jpg)

I didnâ€™t get them out right away b/c I figured the harm had already been done, and I would go ahead and finish emptying the dishwasher before he got into more mischief.&#160;

But, that plan was thwarted when he then decided to DRINK FROM THE DOG BOWL!&#160;&#160;&#160; While I moved the bowl onto the counter and the dirty cups into the sink, I turn around to find him standing in the dishwasher reaching for my leftover pizza from lunch.

At this point, I decide that this has TRULY BEEN THE CRAZIEST HALF HOUR OF HIS LIFE and strap him into his booster seat with my pizza in hopes of keeping him safe and me sane!&#160;
