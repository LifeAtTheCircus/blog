This past week our church hosted Vacation Bible School.  I love that we do vacation Bible School because it provides a tangible way for our church to reach out and serve our surrounding community.  Parents eager for a mid summer break are offered something fun for their kids to get involved in.  Kids come to play games, make crafts, meet friends, eat snacks, sing songs and the leave having had a great time.  Its great to serve.  

But its also a golden oppertunity.  Childeren who might not otherwise harken the doors of a church building are made to feel welcome.  While playing games they also learn about my Lord Jesus.  What an opportunity to show Christ's love to them and to teach them the Word of God.  

I have served in several different capacities over the years but this was the first year that my son got to be involved in the program.  Watching it through his eyes was one of my favorite parts.

Each day as my son eagerly showed me his completed crafts and told me about his morning, I was grateful for the volunteers who poured themselves into my child.  As he enthusiastically prepared to go to church each morning and made sure I met his teachers, I was so thankful for people who were willing to invest in _my child_.  

Children's ministry is a chance to serve not only the children of the community, but their families as well.  When a parents sees someone give of their time and energy to serve their child, it blesses their heart.  I know this first hand.  So, _parents_ that might not otherwise harken the doors of a church building come for 5 days and witness God's people sacrificing their time and energy to invest in their children.   Many came on parents night to watch their children performs their songs, and they had the opportunity to hear God's Word.  Serving at VBS is much, much more than just gluing popsicle sticks and painting cardboard with children looking for something to do on a hot July week.  VBS provides a rare, golden opportunity for our church to demonstrate Christ's love and share His Word with our community.

_My posts typically relate funny anecdotes about the happenings here at the circus.  While my days are seldom “normal” enough to leave me without a “post worthy” moment, I use my last post of the week to highlight something a little more “thoughtful” and significant. If you had a thoughtful post from this last week, or choose to make a new one, please feel free to add a link in the comments section below.  I’d love to hear what others are learning._
