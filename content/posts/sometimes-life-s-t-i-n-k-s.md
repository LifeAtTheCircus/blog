Wednesday was one of _those_ days.   I heard my baby fussing from her nap so I went in to get her.  I knew when I approached the door she needed her diaper changed.  It was that smelly.

(and unlike [last time](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/14/missing-one-very-important-item/), there really was a diaper there, it just didn't seem to hold the goods)!   

After stripping her down and wiping off her entire lower body, I picked her up to go and get the camera from the other room.  

As I entered the room, I wondered if perhaps I missed a spot on my daughter b/c it seemed to smell in here as well.  I rounded the corner only to discover that the dog we are pet sitting this week left a surprise for me in the dining room!

So I strapped my baby into the high chair while I cleaned the dog poop off of the floor.

After cleaning up the floor, I went back to the nursery to strip the sheets so I could soak them, her dress, and her lovey in some oxiclean.  As I carried my daughter down the hall, I looked down at her head and noticed for the first time that I didn't do a thorough job of cleaning the poop off of her.  

Take a close look at her hair...my poor baby must've been rolling around in her own poop!!

After sticking her stuff in the wash to soak, it was back upstairs to give her a bath.   I love this expression on her face, she was so _not amused_ by the whole ordeal.  Can't say that I was all that thrilled myself!

But 45 minutes later the mess was finally behind us!  When asked how my afternoon was, I could only reply, "It stunk!"
