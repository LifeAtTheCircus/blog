The other day I discovered a way to occupy my kids for a good 15-20 min, which many of you know is an eternity in Mommy time.  

Wanna know the secret?  

I let them play with my clock radio.  I plugged it in and placed it on the floor in the living room.  They had a blast taking turns turning it off and on and changing radio stations.  It was more fun then Mommy turning on the stereo, because _they_ had control of turning it on and off as well the fun of switching the music from station to station.  

While they danced, I was able to clean the kitchen and pack our clothes (I could have done more, but I got distracted watching them and _had_ to get it on video). Check out the music video below from my productive morning. I know everyone thinks their own home movies are funny, but since I peed my pants when I saw  son do his fancy footwork in front of the TV, I knew I had to share.   I think you'll enjoy it too.  







  

Let me just answer a few questions now.  

*   Yes, it is noon and my son is still in his PJ's
*   No, my husband and I don't dance like that (we don't think)
*   The leg lift move is new to us too
*   We aren't charismatic though it appears my daughter wants us to be
