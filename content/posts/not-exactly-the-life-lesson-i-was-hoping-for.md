 When I told you of the never ending science lessons going on at the circus this summer, I was excited about my children getting to watch the baby birds grow until they were old enough to fly from the nest.&#160; We learned that Daddy Robins help Mommy’s feed their babies, as we saw both the Mom and Dad at the nest at the same time.&#160; By day 3 we even started seeing their little beaks peak out over the top of the nest in our “Robin cam.”&#160; I was surprised to see how often the Momma left the nest to find food for her little ones.&#160; It seemed she would no sooner arrive at the nest and feed her little babes, that she was off again hunting for food.&#160;

Sadly, on Thursday morning when I turned on the “Robin cam”&#160; I didn’t see any activity in the nest.&#160; Hoping the Momma had just left for awhile, I silently kept an eye on the camera as I went about tidying the house.&#160; I never saw the Momma bird return to the nest.&#160; I never saw the little beaks peaking over the top.&#160; After a few hours with no signs of life, I called Scott to mention my suspicion.&#160; 

The kids hadn’t picked up on it and I hadn’t yet voiced my concerns.&#160; 

Scott had me go out with the mirror to check the nest.&#160; 

It was empty.

We were both so sad.&#160; He said I could wait till he got home to tell the kids and I did.&#160; I just knew he’d&#160; be better at telling them than I would.&#160; 

Before they went to bed last night, we sat them down.&#160; Scott carefully explained “the circle of life.”&#160; He didn’t make what we suspect was a cat or raccoon out to be evil or bad, like I am sure I would have done.

My son took it the hardest, as I suspected he would.&#160; We were all looking forward to watching them grow and learn to fly. 

This was def not the lesson I was excited to teach them this summer.&#160; But, it seems it was the lesson they were meant to be taught.&#160; I do hope we have the opportunity of watching baby birds grow again in our yard, next time hoping they make it till they can safely fly away on their own.&#160;
