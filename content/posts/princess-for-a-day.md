After a fun afternoon at the zoo, we went home I was treated to my favorite foods for dinner and my hubby and kids made me the&#160; traditional cake and ice cream.&#160;&#160; When I blew out my candles, I didn't even make a wish... [my dreams have all come true](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/10/a-dream-come-true/) already, what more could I wish for? 

&#160;

A few things that made me smile today...

&#160;

*   [![IMG_4567](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/img-4567-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/img-45675.jpg)While opening a musical birthday card.&#160; My two year old's face lit up and she instantly started dancing.&#160; When I opened my next card, which was a normal card, she took it, opened it again and remarked, &quot;Uh-oh it's not working!&quot;&#160;
*   My two year old looked over at me at breakfast, pointed to my lei and said, &quot;You're cute!&quot;&#160;
*   At the zoo, when my son saw the ostrich, he mistakenly called it a peacock.&#160; I corrected him and told him they were ostriches.&#160; A few minutes later he said, &quot;Aren't these supposed to be pink?&quot;&#160; Wrong bird again.
*   My son sang me a song called Birthday Rock this evening.&#160; When we asked him where he heard it he responded, &quot;I dreamed about it a long time ago and have been waiting to sing it.&quot;&#160;
