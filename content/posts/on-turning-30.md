I love birthdays.&#160; No really, I mean, I LOVE THEM.&#160; And I’ll be honest, I particularly love MY birthday.&#160; As I kid I would start counting down the days till my birthday starting in January (right around my brother’s birthday).&#160; 

I can remember when Scott and I had been married about a year we were on vacation at the end of June.&#160; My birthday, as you now know is in mid July.&#160; One sunny afternoon I said to Scott, “Ya know, I really don’t think your excited enough about my birthday.”&#160; It was a mere 10 days a way and I didn’t think he was focusing on it enough.&#160;&#160; Yea…I wish I was kidding, but I am not.&#160; I really am that child like.&#160; 

This year, my dear hubby went all out.&#160; Truly, he out did himself and I couldn’t have asked for a better day.&#160; He def was more than excited enough about my special day.&#160; 

 The day started with my getting to sleep in.&#160;&#160; A luxury I don’t get to enjoy all that often these days.&#160; He then woke me up b/c the kids were decorating my birthday cak[![IMG_0453](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_0453.jpg "IMG_0453")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_0453.jpg)e and it was so precious and he knew I would enjoy watching it.&#160; How right he was.&#160; He completely turned the cake decorating over to them.&#160; Gave them the cake, the container of icing and 3 knives and let them have at it.&#160; It was adorable.&#160; It brought back very vivid memories of my dad doing the same thing with my brother and I on my mom’s 30th birthday.&#160; I can remember being so proud and so excited about making her cake pretty.&#160; To see this same love and adoration poured out for me, truly melted my heart.&#160;&#160;&#160;

After cake decorating and a quick bath for all involved parties, it was off for a family day of fun at the zoo.&#160; We had a delightful day.&#160; Our highlights were the polar bears, feeding the giraffe, watching an elephant drink water from his trunk,&#160; seeing the penguins swim, and listening to the leopards growl as they paced right in front of us!&#160;&#160; Such memorable experiences for all of us.&#160; I love the zoo.&#160; I love seeing the animals up close and personal.&#160; I can’t help but marvel at the God who created them.&#160; And I love sharing those experiences with my children.&#160;&#160;

We stopped mid day for a picnic lunch and at the end of our time there we sat under a tree by our car and enjoyed the birthday cake while I opened my presents.&#160; Truly delightful!

&#160; I felt very loved and cherished when my son gave me a popsicle stick frame that he painted and decorated at VBS especially for me.&#160; He’s been so excited about it for the last week.&#160; He remembered my birthday was coming completely on his own, made this for me, and kept it hidden till my birthday.&#160; I was touched.&#160; 

Scott gave me an empty birthday card and informed me that he wrote my card on my blog that day!&#160; How sweet!&#160; I was so excited to go home and read not only his sweet comment, but the comments of so many of my blog friends as well.&#160; I was touched that he included you all in my birthday festivities.&#160; 

On our way to the zoo Scott told me that he got his parents to babysit so he [![IMG_2238](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_2238.jpg "IMG_2238")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_2238.jpg)could take me out to dinner for my birthday.&#160; What a fun surprise!&#160; So, after freshening up at home from our afternoon at the zoo, we dropped the kids off at his parents and headed out for dinner.&#160;&#160; As the waitress was seating us I noticed out of the corner of my eye a familiar face… then another… then gradually in slow motion style, I realized that wait my close friends are all sitting together at a table and SURPRISE!&#160; My dear sweet man had pulled it off.&#160; I had no idea at all.&#160; We had dinner with my close friends at my favorite restaurant!&#160; Truly the perfect ending to an already perfect day!&#160; 

It was such fun to hear about all the scheming and organizing and stress that my husband and friends went through to pull off the surprise.&#160; I don’t like big parties and I don’t really like surprises, b/c typically I figure out the surprise and hate the stress of trying to act surprised when I am not.&#160; This was perfect.&#160; Not too big, just the right size.&#160; Completely unexpected (I had thought Scott had told me a month ago that he wasn’t doing a party for me, so it never entered my mind).&#160;&#160;&#160; What a good time!!&#160;

I’d say, so far 30 is pretty wonderful!
