Tonight I had a hot date with my hubby.  My son's birthday is coming up and we needed to go shopping for his present.  Since we had to get a babysitter to watch the kids, we decided to take full advantage of that fact and we went out for dinner as well.  I really enjoyed having an uninterrupted conversation with him while getting to hold his hand as we walked into the store.   As we pulled into Toys R Us after our dinner out, I realized that the last time we went on a date we went to Toys R Us for our daughter's birthday gift.  Funny how kids change things.... we now go to Toys R Us for our hot dates.  :-)
