Today the following conversation took place between me and my 4 year old son as we were driving home from the store.
 > Son:  Mom, can I see a real brain some day?
> 
> Me:  You want to see grain? 
> 
> Son:  No a BRAIN
> 
> pause (and I had been trying to figure out where to find grain...if only...)
> 
> Me:  I don't think so, that would be pretty tough
> 
> Son:  Well, if someone died and then we cut their head open, then we could see what their brain looked like
> 
> another pause...(Did my sweet, innocent little  boy just say that)?
> 
> gulp
> 
> Me: True, but that would be pretty gross, don't you think?
> 
> Son:  Yea... 

So, I am hoping that this little conversation can be taken as an indication that my son will grow up to be a brain surgeon some day because the alternative is down right scary!
