 This winter Scott and I watched the movie [The Pursuit of Happyness](http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/thepursuitofhappyness/) starring Will Smith.&#160; Few movies have stuck with me as much as this one.&#160; My heart was so heavy as I watched this very smart man struggle to provide for his son.&#160; The thing that got Scott and I the most, was how immensely blessed we are.&#160; We were given so many opportunities that others don’t get.&#160; We don’t have what we do because we deserve it.&#160; It’s not because we are smarter or work harder or are more responsible.&#160; God has given us so many blessings.&#160; They are gifts.&#160; This was immensely humbling to me.&#160; And it made me all the more sensitive to those who don’t have what I do.&#160; It makes me eager to reach out and share what I have with those in need.&#160; The movie put a story behind [the faces I see on the side of the street.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/03/08/making-new-friends/)&#160;&#160; If you haven’t seen it, I encourage you to do so.&#160;&#160; 

We also recently read the book [Under the Overpass](http://www.undertheoverpass.com).&#160; I highly recommend this book.&#160; It is an easy and quick read and very convicting.&#160; Two college age Christians take time away from their studies to live on the streets for 6 mths.&#160; They essentially become missionaries to the homeless in the U.S.&#160; They lived in 6 different cities for approximately one month at a time.&#160;&#160; This book records their journey.&#160; It is humbling and saddening to see how people who claim to be Christians respond to them as homeless.&#160; 

The author truly struck a chord with Scott and I.&#160; He encourages the reader to be passionate about living out our faith in deeds.&#160; Doing more than just talking about our faith, but living it out.&#160;&#160; The author talks on his webpage about “living out loud” and that is something we are striving to do.&#160;&#160; 

I like what he says in the last chapter, 
  > “_Fortunately, “the love your neighbor” part of Jesus’ teaching starts with the simple actions and small opportunities that are available to each of us.&#160; Little things do mean a lot, especially in the kingdom of God, where giving a drink of cold water has eternal repercussions.&#160; And
>  I am convinced that the more committed we become to impacting one person at a time-whether through a cup of coffee or a genuine conversation- the more we’ll prepare our hearts and our churches to respond at both a community and national level.&#160; The bottom line is real love always shows itself in action.”

I strongly encourage you to take the time to read the book and let him challenge you and your thinking and actions.&#160; You can find more info on the book [here](http://www.undertheoverpass.com).&#160; I know I finished quite humbled and quite eager to do more to serve our Lord, by serving His people.&#160; 

Last month I wasn’t able to join Scott when he went back out [to deliver lunches](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/03/08/making-new-friends/), due to the stomach bug makings its way through our family.&#160;&#160; I am eagerly looking forward to serving alongside him this month and to looking for more ways to live my faith out loud.
