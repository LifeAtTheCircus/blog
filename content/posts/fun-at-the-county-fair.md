Every fall, since my first born was only 5 months old, I’ve taken my children to the county fair.&#160; We don’t by any stretch live in a rural area, so I am sure some of you country folk would laugh and heckle what we call a county fair.&#160; But, for my suburbanite children and I, it offers a rare opportunity to see some farm animals up close.&#160;&#160;&#160; It is a fall tradition we look forward to all summer long!&#160; 

Of the 6 years I’ve gone, this was by far my favorite year.&#160; Not sure if it was because the exhibits were that much better, or if it was b/c my children were older and better able to enjoy and participate in the event, or b/c I wasn’t pushing a stroller or nursing a baby in the midst of the farm fun.&#160; Either way, it was a glorious morning at the fair.&#160;
