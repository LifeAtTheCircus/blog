 My 2 year old daughter loves Sesame Street.

Except for this guy.

Every time he comes on the screen, she does this.

The first time he scared her, I came into the room to find her laying face down on the couch crying.  I asked her what was wrong and she said, "Cookie Monster yelled at me!"  I think she really thought he was yelling at her when he was screaming for his cookies.

Now every time he comes on, my son will quickly warn my daughter to cover her eyes because Cookie Monster is on!
