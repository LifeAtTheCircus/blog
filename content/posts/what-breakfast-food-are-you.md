I found this survey from [The Dust Bunny Hostage](http://dustbunnyhostage.blogspot.com/) and thought I'd give it a try.  It was sadly, pretty accurate on my need for more veggies in my diet.  Other than that, I think it kinda missed the mark... I'd consider myself more of a cereal girl.  But a fun quiz, none the less... check it out and let me know what breakfast food you are!

Indulgent and a bit greedy, you eat whatever you feel like eating... forget about nutrition.
  

You have a total sweet tooth, and you pretty much give into it whenever you feel like it.  

While treating yourself is nice occasionally, try eating a vegetable every once and a while.  

Lay off the donuts and muffins, unless you want to be sporting a "muffin top" of your own!
