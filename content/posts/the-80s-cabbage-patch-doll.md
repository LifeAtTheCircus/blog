The other day when she handed "baby doll" to me because she was "sick"  I took a good look at my old doll.  I remember her well.  Her name was Tamara Jill and I affectionately called her TJ for short.  She was a corn silk cabbage patch doll.  I remember the silky smooth hair being quite the upgrade from the yarn hair of my other doll.
