Hmmm…we’re on day 3 of our [grand Texas adventure](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/03/ambitious-or-crazy/)…and the circus crew has come down with quite a few ailments.  My hoarse voice has developed into full laryngitis.  My son has gotten a case of pink eye.  My baby has developed a fever.  And the middle child has nothing specific yet, but I did detect a little runny nose this evening.

NICE, huh?  

Guess we just wanted to feel at home, so we brought the plague of the past few months along with us.  

We leave today for the 4 day camping portion of our adventure.  We’ve called the Dr back home and gotten prescription eye drops for the pink eye and are bracing ourselves to use it on the rest of the family as it is highly contagious and we will be in close proximity of each other.  

So far, we are still enjoying ourselves.  Every now and then I want to grumble and cry, “_why now? why on vacation_”  But I am determined not to let it ruin our fun time away.  “This is the day the Lord has made and I WILL rejoice in it.”  Sometimes I gotta remind myself of that again and again.  Truly, it could be worse.  We’ve had a great time with family and friends and are looking forward to spending the next few days in God’s creation.  I am praying for restored health (and would appreciate it if any of ya’ll wanted to join me in that prayer).  (Like the Texas drawl I’ve picked up?)  Perhaps some time in the great outdoors will do us all some good?  Here’s hoping anyway…
