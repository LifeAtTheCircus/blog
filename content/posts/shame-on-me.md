Much like I do almost every day, I loaded my sweet baby girl into her car seat.&#160; I buckled her in and then handed her a purple sippy cup.

After strapping her sister in her seat and after double checking her brother, I went to my spot in the front.&#160; 

About 20 minutes later I looked back and saw my sweet baby girl holding two purple sippy cups.

“Where did that other cup come from?”

I quickly took both cups and tried to figure out which was the good one and which cup **of milk** was from our drive **2 Nights Ago.**

About 10 minutes later my poor little girl puked curdled milk all over her self.&#160; 

My poor sweet girl!&#160; She guzzled her sippy cup expecting some nice fresh milk, only to have her momma give her 2 day old spoiled, rotten milk.&#160; I felt awful!!&#160; 

Shame on Me
