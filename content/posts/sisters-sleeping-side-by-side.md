More times than not, when I peek in on my girls before heading to bed, I find them sleeping together.&#160; 

Sometimes this means they are both down on the bottom bunk.

Sometimes, it means they are side by side in their drawers (truthfully I find them like this almost as often as I find them in the bottom bunk).&#160;

Sometimes they are both on the floor.&#160; (haven’t found them like that in the last 2 weeks)

And once, last week, I even found them side by side in the same drawer.&#160; [![IMG_1430](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_1430.jpg "IMG_1430")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_1430.jpg)

As I peek in on them snuggled up together, it gives me hope that as they grow, they’ll share secrets, slumber parties, and hopefully a life long friendship, side by side….
