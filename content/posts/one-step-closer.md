Since before each of my children were born, my hearts deepest desire has been for them to know the Lord Jesus as their Savior.&#160;&#160; My son has demonstrated to us numerous times through various conversations that he recognizes he is a sinner and Christ died on the cross to forgive his sins.&#160; 

[![IMG_7023](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_7023.jpg "IMG_7023")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_7023.jpg) My girls have not come to that point yet, but this Easter season we got one step closer.&#160; We did the [Resurrection Eggs](http://www.christianbook.com/resurrection-eggs-english-spanish-text-updated/9781602001831/pd/001831?kw=001831&amp;en=froogle&amp;p=1013824&amp;cm_mmc=CBDfeeds-_-froogle-_-gifts-_-001831) with the kids this year and the way we did it was to start 12 days prior to Easter and open one egg each day leading up to Easter Sunday, opening the 12th egg, Easter night.&#160; We would spend time review the previously discussed eggs each night, with the hopes of truly solidifying the Easter story in their hearts and minds and helping them to grasp the significance of the events leading up to our Lord’s death and resurrection.&#160; 

One night we were discussing the cross and my husband asked my oldest daughter some questions.&#160; 
  > “Who died on the cross?”
> 
> “Jesus”
> 
> “Why did he die on the cross?”
> 
> “Because he loved us.”
> 
> “What did he die for?”
> 
> “Our sins”
> 
> “Whose sins?”
> 
> “All of our sins”
> 
> “Did he die for your sins?”
> 
> “He died for EVERYBODY’S sins”  

It took several rounds of discussing and questioning to get her to not just answer everybody’s sins, but to get her to say that he died for HER SINS.&#160; And this was a crucial first step towards her coming to a saving faith of her own.

This is a huge point, that in my opinion is well worth spending time on.&#160; It can be easy to say, “Yes, Jesus died on the cross for all of our sins.”&#160; My girls can even tell you that sins are the bad things we do and that Jesus didn’t do anything bad.&#160; But, until my child recognizes that **she herself** is a sinner, that Jesus died on the cross to take the consequences of **her** sins, until she makes it personal, she won’t recognize **her need** for a personal Savior.&#160; 

My prayer for my kids isn’t simply that they grow up with a sound head knowledge of Christian doctrine.&#160; My prayer is that my children will have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.&#160; That they will call Him Lord.&#160; This relationship is possible only because Christ, who had no sin, took the consequence of our sin upon Himself when he died on the cross.&#160; With the consequence paid, the perfectly just creator God can be united with me and my imperfect daughters.&#160; Jesus is the mediator between us and God, but only if we personally acknowledge our need for a mediator.&#160; 

Before my girls can have that personal relationship with our Lord, they need to first recognize that they personally are a sinner.&#160; That their personal sins were enough to require Jesus to die on the cross.&#160; He did it for them.&#160; Once they recognize that point, then they can grasp what is means to call Christ their personal savior.&#160; Then, once Christ is their Lord, they can go on to live the life of purpose God intends for them. 

I eagerly await that day.&#160; We’re one step closer.
