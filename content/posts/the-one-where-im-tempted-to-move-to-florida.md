I hear his cries and stumble out of bed.&#160; Cradling my son in my arms I make my way down the hall and to the couch where I sit to nurse him.&#160; My eyes are burning, begging me to let them close again.&#160; Instead I grab my phone and start scrolling through face book trying to keep myself awake while my little guy eagerly chugs down on his 4 am meal.&#160; Not much has changed on face book since I last checked at 1 am.&#160; Oddly, most of my friends aren’t up between 1 and 4 am and if they are, they aren't doing anything they want posted on face book for the world to see.&#160; 

So, I grab the remote to see if there is something to 
entertain me 
keep me awake in these early morning hours.&#160; One night I struck gold and found a rerun of [The Cosby Show](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086687/) playing on [Nick At Nit](http://www.nickatnite.com/)e (when did I become old enough for the shows I watched as a kid to be played on Nick At Nite)?&#160; 

This night however I found myself watching an infomercial on [Space Bags](https://www.spacebag.com/10/Default.aspx).&#160; Have you seen these things?&#160; It’s amazing how much you can fit into them once you vacuum up the air.&#160; As I sat there watching, they just kept making the offer sound better and better.&#160; “But wait, if you order now, we’ll double the amount of bags… that’s right 4 space bags for only $19.95…”&#160; the longer I sat, the more they kept throwing in, a nifty organizer to put the bags in, another set of bags…. I found myself way more tempted than I care to admit to “pick up the phone and call now.”&#160; It sounded like such a great deal!

I have decided that these infomercials are played at 4am for that very reason… they want to prey on you while your weak.&#160; When your too tired to even change the remote from a 30 minute commercial, you are also too tired to think clearly enough to make a purchase.&#160; Thankfully, I was also too tired to hunt down my purse and credit card info.&#160; 

As I relayed the amazing deal to my husband the next day he chuckled and said it reminded him of the property in Florida.&#160; 

“Property in Florida?”&#160; 

Didn’t know the Circus had beach front property in the Sunshine State?

Well, we don’t… but boy was I tempted about 6 yrs ago.&#160; Again I was up in the middle of the night nursing, (different son, same couch)… this time the guy from [CHiPs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075488/) (a show **__ I** watched on Nick at Nite as a child) was on telling me about a great deal for ocean front property in Florida.&#160; It sounded amazing and the price was **_unbelievable!&#160;_** I sat for longer than I care to admit trying to figure out what could possibly be wrong with this neighborhood and why wouldn’t we want to move there right away…it was all I could do not to run down the hall and wake Scott to check it out.&#160; 

When I told him the next day, I tried to tell him in a “ha ha, you’ll never believe what I saw on tv last night” way but couldn’t hide my enthusiasm as I relayed the location and price of this property.&#160;&#160; 

We stayed put in Maryland.&#160; 

Careful what you watch at 4am… you could find yourself packing all your belongings in a space bag and moving to Florida!&#160;
