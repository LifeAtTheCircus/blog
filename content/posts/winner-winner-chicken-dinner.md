Anyone who knows me, knows that I love Chick-Fil-A.&#160; So, when I found out that they were opening a new one in Pasadena AND they had a “Raving-Fan” contest on face book in which the winner would win a year of free Chick-Fil-A, I had to enter.

The contest:&#160; submit a photo of your favorite memory at Chick-Fil-A and explain it in 100 words or less.

My favorite memory at Chick-fil-A??&#160; How ever will I choose?

&#160;

The time I requested Chick-Fil-A after giving birth to my daughter and my brother did a CFA run for me to deliver it to me at the hospital.

&#160;

&#160;

Or her birthday party four years later?

How about our anniversary dinner [while in labor](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/06/08/birth-story-number-4/) with baby number 4?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; _(as in, for real laboring - went to the hospital right from there)_

Or when given the choices of any restaurant at Disney World, the circus family happily chooses Chick-Fil-A for the last 2 meals of their vacation?

Or any number of times that I dressed my children up as cows to earn free dinner?

I opted for the [2009 Cow Appreciation Day.”](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/07/13/branded/)_We have made it a family tradition to participate in Cow Appreciation Day for the past 6 years.&#160; 2 years ago we invited one of our best friends to join us.&#160; They ended up having an appt to look at a prospective house on the way to our dinner. The Realtor graciously agreed to follow us to CFA afterward, so we didn't miss Cow Appreciation day, and they signed the paper work there while we entertained the kids in the play area.”_

Our story was selected as a finalist [(original post here).](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/07/13/branded/)&#160; We got to go to a Premiere Dinner at the new Chick-Fil-A before it opened.&#160; This alone, made me giddy!!&#160; 

But, as if THAT wasn’t good enough… while there sipping our Sweet Tea… they read our story aloud to the room, and WE WON!!!

Without a doubt… best thing I have ever won… ever…. with 52 coupons for free combo meals, we can take our family of 6 out to dinner at Chick-Fil-A once a month for a year!!&#160; This makes for one VERY happy circus family!!

How about you? Do you have a favorite memory at Chick-Fil-A?
