I know you’ve heard of comfort foods…typically something warm and gooey that reminds you of home or growing up or just makes you feel good inside.&#160; 

Well, this preggo woman has comfort clothes.&#160; And they aren’t pretty.&#160; [![IMG_6575](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6575.jpg "IMG_6575")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6575.jpg)OK, let me explain.&#160; (oh, how I wish there was a good explanation…)&#160; When I was pregnant with my son I got to be so, ahem large, that I started stealing shirts from Scott’s tee shirt drawers…Not to wear in public mind you, but I did wear them around the house so I could save my “cute “maternity clothes for when I saw people.&#160; And since I am so considerate, I stayed away from shirts he typically wore and went for the ones in the back of the drawer.&#160; 

[![IMG_6578](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6578.jpg "IMG_6578")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6578.jpg)And that is where this one comes in.&#160; Let’s take a closer look, shall we?&#160;&#160; Rumor has it he got this shirt on the family cross country trip in 1994.&#160; It was a wonderful, memory filled trip and this shirt was one of the coveted, carefully chosen souvenirs.&#160; 

I have no real good explanation for why I chose it though, Indian clothing isn’t typically my style.&#160; But, you can’t choose who you love, you know?&#160; Love chooses you.

And so it became my comfy preggo shirt.&#160; Ya know the one you slip into when you get home from work? 

Only with pregnancy number 2, 3, and 4, work was at home and so I slipped into it a little more often.&#160; And sad to say, for some reason, love blinded me, and&#160; I lost sight of what it was I was wearing and perhaps I began wearing it with greater frequency.&#160; 

As in, my sister in law caught me in it when she was over one day and said, “Didn’t Scott get that shirt on our cross country trip?”&#160; busted…. I had worn it in front of company. What have I turned into?

Yea, pretty sure [Stacy and Clinton](http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/whatnottowear/geton/) will be showing up on my door step any day now.&#160;
