[![IMG_2711](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-2711-thumb.jpg "IMG_2711")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-2711.jpg)I don’t remember what magazine or book I read it from, but a few years ago I found an idea for having a wise man celebration.&#160; For some reason I recall it being on January 6th. And I decided it was a good idea.&#160; But that year my entire family got struck with the stomach virus, so we skipped it.&#160; But last year and this year we celebrated, thus making it a tradition at our house.&#160; 

We make stir fry or Chinese food (because the wise men came from the East) for dinner and we bake star shaped sugar cookies for dessert.&#160; We wear crowns, like the kings and we watch the wise man movie ([The First Noel).](http://www.veryfirstnoel.com/)&#160; [![IMG_2703](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-2703-thumb.jpg "IMG_2703")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-2703.jpg)

Since we are a young family, in many ways we are still shaping our traditions.&#160; Since our first year of marriage we have hung a Jesus stocking.&#160; In it Scott and I write a note about what we want to give to Jesus that year.&#160; This year we decided to combine the Jesus stocking with Wiseman day.&#160; We discussed as a family what we could like to do together as a gift for Jesus and the kids will draw a representative picture to put into the stocking.&#160; 

I like celebrating Wiseman Day because it provides another opportunity to tell and retell the Christmas story and to keep our focus on the real meaning of the season.&#160;&#160; Typically the tree is down and the decorations are away by the 6th and it is nice to take some time to continue to dwell on Christ’s birth, after the “holiday season” is past. 

Wiseman Day [works for me](http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/shannon/) and my family as it provides a fun family night with a focus on our Lord and on what we can give to Him as we worship Him.&#160; To find more great ideas and helpful tips, visit [Rocks in My Dryer](http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/shannon/).
