With Fathers Day approaching this weekend and the kids and I brainstorming ways to make it ultra special for the circus dad, I feel it also appropriate to spend some time reflecting on my own father. 

Because, when it comes to dad’s, I have been richly blessed.&#160; 

While in the throws of parenthood, I think many a parents wonders, “Is it making a difference?&#160; Do my kids even notice?”&#160; 

And the answer is a resounding “Yes!”

Now a mother myself as I look back on my childhood, I am so grateful, so deeply grateful for the relationship I have had with my dad.&#160; 

As I think of my dad, many thoughts come to mind… he’s hardworking, always a kidder, a follower of Christ, great with kids, a loving and attentive Grandpa, sports fan, great shopper…. but if I had to some it up in one word, I’d say my dad is dependable.&#160; 

Dad was always there when we needed him.&#160;&#160; My brother and I went to a Christian high school that was about 30 min from our house.&#160; I recall dad going out of his way to take us to school and drop us off.&#160; He’d wait patiently in the parking lot for us, scheduling his work appts around our dismissal times.&#160; He made it to our band competitions, and sports games, and school plays.&#160; And now, as an adult, he’s still there for me.&#160; He makes the trek to MD to visit me and my family multiple times a year.&#160; He does his best to make it to the kids birthday parties and sports games.&#160; He was there at the hospital to meet each of his grandchildren after they were born.&#160; This sometimes meant driving late into the night after a full day of work only to drive that same long trek back home to go to work shortly after.&#160; But, dad was there.&#160; 

I have one very vivid memory of my dad which truly means the world to me.&#160; It was the end of my senior year of high school.&#160; Math is subject I struggled with all through high school.&#160; After being accepted to college, I had to go and take some kind of entrance test or something.&#160; I don’t really recall the details of that, all I do recall is finding out that I was going to have to take a remedial math class my first semester of college.&#160; It would be a non credit math class that I had to take and pass before I could even take the regular math class I needed to fulfill my requirements.&#160;&#160; Looking back now, it really wasn’t a big deal.&#160; It was one class, take it, pass, and move along.&#160; But, then, as a 17 yr old girl, it was devastating… the end of the world… in fact.&#160; “I’m dumb… I hate math… I’m never going to pass… this is awful.”&#160; Truthfully, my pride was hurt.&#160; And that in and of itself was the issue.&#160;&#160;&#160; I went out that night with Scott and some friends… I recall coming home late and dad waiting up for me in the living room.&#160; I remember walking in the door, and Dad coming over to me and just giving me a big hug.&#160; He said, “Mom told me about your math.”&#160; Instantly I was embarrassed again.&#160;&#160; “Your going to be ok,”&#160; He said, “I know it’s not easy for you, but it’ll all work out.” 

And ya know.&#160; He was right.&#160; I took the class.&#160; I was embarrassed that first week when I couldn’t find the building and had to ask a million and one people where it was b/c no one had heard of the building, b/c actually it was off campus at a Sylvan learning center, and thus I had to tell a million and one people that I was taking remedial math.&#160; But I found the building, took the class, passed, took the required math classes after that, passed… and life went on.&#160; In the scheme of life, it was a very little deal.&#160; And yet 15 years later I still look back at that night… at dad waiting up just to give me a hug… at Dad letting me know he cared, he understood how I felt, and ya know what it was a big deal.&#160;&#160; Because it illustrates yet again, that dad was there.&#160; He cared.&#160; He supported me.&#160;

And that’s the kind of dad he is.&#160; Dependable, supportive, understanding.&#160;&#160; I’m so thankful, so very thankful for my dad.&#160; Happy Fathers Day Dad!!
