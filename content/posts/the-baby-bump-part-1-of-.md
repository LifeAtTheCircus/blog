That’s right folks… a little tiny baby bump is making his or her appearance into the world.&#160; I alluded to the fact [earlier when I mentioned](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/12/06/a-little-bit-of-this-and-a-little-bit-of-that/) I was now in maternity clothes.&#160; And I figured, why not share this bump with the rest of you?&#160; Because for some unexplainable reason we seem to enjoy looking at others increasing waistbands and what other time in my life would I willingly post a picture of my belly for the world to see? 

That answer, would be, ummm, never.&#160; 

So, enjoy…here I am at week 15.&#160;&#160;&#160;

And here’s the baby bump when looking at it from my perspective…complete with dog hairs on my black sweater.

Yesterday, I took my oldest daughter on a mommy date.&#160; It was delightful and I am sure I will post on that special time really soon.&#160; But, the day began with a trip to the “baby doctor” in which she got to sit up on the table with mommy and hold the microphone over my belly to hear the heart beat of our little baby.&#160; It was a precious moment and totally put the doctor who had previously been on my bad side, now totally on my good side.&#160;&#160; I also got the referral for our sonogram and called yesterday afternoon.&#160; In early January we’ll all be crowding in the sonogram room to see the face of our sweet little baby!&#160; I can hardly wait!
