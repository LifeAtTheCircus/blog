My Daybook: Monday January 12     
**Outside my window...**the sun is shining brightly and Christmas lights still hang on the front of the house (though no longer on the roof…we’re half way there)      
**I am thinking...**I really need to stop putting off folding the laundry piled beside my bed      
**I am thankful for...** the Steelers victory last night advancing them to the AFC Championship      
**From the learning room…**working on Catechism questions      
**From the kitchen...** Scott will be making pancakes for him and the kids for dinner tonight      
**I am wearing...**jeans and my Steelers Superbowl XL Champions Tee      
**I am creating...** I am not that creative, I do hope to tackle hemming my sons pants this week, does that count?      
**I am going...**to MOPS tonight at my church (hence the pancake dinner tonight)      
**I am reading...** [Love Walked in] (http://www.amazon.com/Love-Walked-Marisa-los-Santos/dp/0452287898/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1231121639&amp;sr=8-1)by Marisa de los Santos, The One Year Chronological Bible, Teaching Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons      
**I am hoping...** my kids wake up in good moods      
**I am hearing...**the sounds of my dishwasher running      
**Around the house...**the kids are all napping quietly in their beds      
**One of my favorite things...**home made bread rolls fresh from the oven      
**A few plans for the rest of the week**: catch up on laundry, try to plan some snowman crafts to do with the kiddos

**Here is picture thought I am sharing...**

Do you think we could fit something else into that bed with her?
