Our conversations used to be about teachers and homework, now they are about how we’re going to school our own kids.&#160; We used to discuss boys and dream about our future, now many of us are married to those boys and discuss how many children we plan to have.&#160; They were the ones I called when Scott first told me he liked me, and when he first kissed me, and when he asked me to be his wife.&#160; They were also the ones I couldn’t wait to tell when we were expecting our first baby (and our 2nd, and our 3rd, and our 4th).&#160; 

So many things have changed since we were in high school.&#160; We’ve traded in the plaid uniform kilts for nursing bras and maternity clothes.&#160;&#160; We see each other a lot less frequently.&#160; Used to be we saw each other every day, now months can go by without a phone call or a visit.&#160; 

But when we get together again, in many ways it truly feels like nothing has changed at all.&#160; Because these friends knew me then, but they know me now as well.&#160; They’ve been around as I’ve grown and changed and so our friendship isn’t solely rooted in the past, but very much in the present and the future as well.&#160; In fact in many ways, I feel more closely bonded to them now, than when we were teenagers. 

This month 3 of the 6 girls from my high school circle of friends had babies.&#160; And this week the gang all got together to swap delivery stories and introduce the newest babes to each other, and celebrate these precious new lives!&#160;

And even though I got home at 1am and still had to feed my baby and get up a few hours later to feed him again, I truly had a fantastic time and left with a full heart… so grateful for these women who have been&#160; part of my life, my heart, and my family for so many years.&#160;
