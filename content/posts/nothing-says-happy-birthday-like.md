My little brother celebrated his birthday this week.&#160; And being the good big sister that I am, I thought I’d share some lovely pics of him growing up for my [Fro Me to You](http://www.wearethatfamily.com) post this week.&#160; Cuz’ nothing says happy birthday like having your big sister post your picture on the internet for the world to see.

Happy Birthday Little Brother!

We look pretty dressed up for birthday gifts, so I am guessing his birthday fell on a Sunday that year and he got to open his gifts before we left for church.

I was stylin, don’t ya think?

He is my only brother.&#160; While we definitely had our moments growing up, I’d say we were pretty close.&#160; I have fond memories of playing Star Wars and GI Joes with him (I was always Princess Leah cooking food and cleaning house for the troops).&#160; I was a bossy big sister and it took me awhile to figure out that he didn’t need “another mom” as he would tell me time and again.&#160; Once I learned that, we were great friends.&#160; 

We were both in each other’s weddings and have been to the hospital to welcome our new niece’s and nephews.&#160;&#160; I’m excited that our kids are close in age and hope that they the cousins will be good friends growing up.&#160;&#160;&#160;

I am thankful to have him as my brother, friend, and my children’s uncle. 

Happy Birthday Bro!&#160; I love you lots!
