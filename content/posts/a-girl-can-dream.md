When talking to my oldest daughter about things to look forward to in 2012, I mentioned to her that the Summer Olympics were going to happen in 2012. 

“Oh,” she exclaimed, “I’ll be 6, can I be in the Olympics?”

I told her that when she was 6 she can try out for the gymnastics team at her gym, but she has to be 16 to try out for the Olympics. 

“Well,” she said, “I’ll have the 6, I just need the teen!”

I opted to leave it at that and omitted details about the selection committee, the Károlyi’s and the slew of other things that would stand in the way of her and London this summer.&#160; No need to dash a young girls dreams!

Even though she isn’t on the Olympic team… or any team for that matter, I am super proud of the skills she’s accomplished this past year.&#160;&#160; A year ago she couldn’t yet do a pullover… now she can do a pullover, cast, back hip circle and is working on her dismount.&#160;&#160; _A year ago I couldn’t have told you what any of those things meant… I guess we’ve both learned a lot this past year!_&#160; Here’s a clip we snapped of her at practice a few weeks ago.
