I’ve seen various posts every now and then linked up to [I Heart faces](http://iheartfaces.blogspot.com/) weekly photo contests.&#160; And I’ve thought about entering, but then never did.&#160; When I heard the theme this week was “I Wanna Dance”&#160; I knew I had to link up a picture from our [impromptu New Years Eve dance party](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/01/05/dancing-in-the-new-year/) in our living room.&#160; The hardest part for me, was picking which picture.&#160; Hope I made the right choice.&#160;&#160;
