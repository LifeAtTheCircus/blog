Growing up, part of me wished for a sister… one to share a room with, share clothes and secrets with…. _maybe if I’d have had one, I would know better how to braid my girls hair_…&#160; I had a great brother, and I would never have traded him for a sister, yet part of me at times felt like I was missing out a little…

When I married Scott I instantly gained in my sister-in-law the sister I had always wanted.&#160; And she is all that and more.&#160; And to sweeten the deal even more, Karen and I share a birthday.&#160; We joke that it’s perfect because it makes it so much easier for him to remember my birthday _(that would work IF he could remember his sisters birthday)._

I truly couldn’t love [Karen](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/) more if she was my blood.&#160; I’ve known Karen for more than half my life… in HS I was her secret sister in lacrosse.&#160; While Scott and I were dating in college, she let me crash in her dorm room (often even sharing her top bunk) so I could come and visit Scott at Grove City.&#160; We’ve [run races together](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/25/we-did-it/), shared a mouth guard (gross I know), she’s cut my hair, told me not to wear that jacket with that dress, she was my maid of honor in our wedding…

She became [that shopping partner I needed](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/02/what-not-to-wear/) and is great for the clothing consults… [(even cross country).](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/04/18/cross-country-fashion-consult/)&#160; I appreciate her humor and her realness.&#160; I respect her faith and her strength.&#160; She is an awesome Army wife.&#160; She’s a great mom, so laid back and easy going.&#160; And she is one, fantabulous aunt.&#160; (_I love listening to my girls play with their baby dolls b/c one is always the mom and the other is always the Aunt Karen_).&#160;&#160; I appreciate how important family is to Karen and [all the effort she makes to be an active and real part of our family’s lives,](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/02/15/saying-goodbye/) despite the distance she has always lived from us.&#160; It means more to me than she could ever know.&#160;&#160; 

Last week we visited Karen and Jim on our way to and from Fl and during quiet/nap time, the two of us got to escape for a little Starbucks date (One of my favorite things to do with Karen).&#160; It was like a pre-birthday gift to ourselves.&#160; ![Smile](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wlEmoticon-smile.png)&#160;&#160; I love that we share a birthday… kinda seals the whole sisterhood thing, ya know?&#160;&#160; So, happy birthday Karen… my friend, my sister, and my birthday buddy!&#160; I love you bunches!!!
