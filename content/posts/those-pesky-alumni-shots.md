Our College has an alumni book which they publish quarterly.  In the back is a section where they put baby pics of the alumni's children (wearing their GCC shirts of course).  

When our son was born we were so excited to contact the school and get our tee shirt.  I remember taking the picture when he was around 10 mths old.  Our hard drive crashed the next day and while we did eventually get all the pictures back, when we did that GCC pic was no longer in the fore front of my mind.  

Then baby number two came along and I thought I might as well just take the pic with the two of them together.  But I never got around to getting that second shirt.

Enter baby number three...still no shot for the alumni newsletter.  

Last week my hubby was back at our college campus doing some recruiting for his work.  He paid a visit to the bookstore and now all three have their own paraphernalia.  

Of course getting the group shot is not an easy feat.  These were not exactly the pictures I wanted to share with our college graduates and friends.  

But, after taking (no lie) 
31 

pictures of the three of them in their new shirts, I settled on either of these pictures as being acceptable for the book.  Which do you like best?

I e-mailed the college to find out where to send my pictures to and found out that  "_our policy is to include only those children 3 years and under.  Therefore, the older one will be cropped out of the picture.  Or you could take another one of  
just the 2 and 1 year olds and send that."_  

So, it looks like I am not done, but instead back to the drawing board again to take more pictures, this time of just the girls.  And my poor first born will miss out on the thrilling opportunity to have his picture in the alumni magazine, because his mommy didn't have her act together and waited 4 years to take his baby picture.
