Even my youngest had fun with the piglets…[![IMG_5019](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_5019.jpg "IMG_5019")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_5019.jpg)

We drove a little over an hour to get there and the feeding didn’t last long, so we extended our stay a bit by sampling some of [the creamery’s](http://www.prigelfamilycreamery.com/Prigel_Family_Creamery/Welcome.html) delicious ice cream.&#160; The family was super kind to allow us to purchase ice cream before they were opened.&#160; Ice Cream at 10am?!&#160; Sure thing!&#160;
