This year we had another eclectic crew going door to door pedaling for candy.

We had Big Ben Roethlisberger.

and a knight…. who put together his own costume with the help of his older sister, Athena, all with supplies gathered in our costume bin.

Things I loved were the fact that the boys costumes cost me nothing, as they gathered the supplies from around our house… and the girls costumes can be used again this spring for our history night at school, since we are studying ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome this year. 

We also had an eclectic group of pumpkins…. a butterfly, a gymnast, a dragon, and our 11 year old did his entirely on his own this year….
