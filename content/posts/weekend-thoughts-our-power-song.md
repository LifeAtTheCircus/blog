You know your family is a techno family when your 5 year old requests that you add a song to your ipod so he can listen to it.&#160; Today, my son did just that and I was more than happy to oblige him with this choice.&#160; The “theme song” for our Vacation Bible School this year was “Today is the Day” by Lincoln Brewster.&#160; They sang it every morning at the start of VBS.&#160; It had the kids jumping and praising.&#160; Can’t think of a better start to the day.&#160; 2 weeks later and it is still in my son’s head and he wanted me to download it so we could sing along at home with frequency.&#160; 

I have many playlists on my ipod.&#160; One for running, one for kids songs, one for worship music, one with love songs,&#160; and one I entitled “upbeat fun” specifically designed to get us moving and grooving during those difficult 4-6pm hours of the day.&#160; 

In addition to my ipod, I have a little gadget called the nike+ipod.&#160; I plug one part into my nano and one part slips into my shoe.&#160; I use it while running and it has many great features (tracks my distance, rate, over all time...just to name a few).&#160; One of my favorite features is called the “power song” which you can play when you need instant motivation.&#160; It’s nice to be able to program in “the one song that always gets you through the home stretch.”

After my son requested his song, I got to thinking we could put that “power song” principal into effect at our house.&#160; When we’ve got a case of the grumpies (myself included) or we’re fighting, or short tempered…I can play our “power song” to get us through the home stretch.&#160; To redirect our thoughts and attitudes and get them in the right perspective.&#160; The song needs to be upbeat and fun, so we can let loose and dance a little.&#160; But, it can’t just be a silly song.&#160; Silly songs are great, but for our power song, I want it to direct us back to God.&#160; I think our power song will change from time to time.&#160; We’ll find new songs that resonate with us in a particular way and I can change it up a bit.&#160; But, for now I am going to give this new song a try.&#160; I’ll have it in my ipod on a playlist called “power song” and when I feel we need instant motivation, I will go and turn it on and see if it helps give all of us an attitude adjustment.&#160;&#160; 

I know personally, this week as I was focused on my to do list, I found myself a bit uptight from time to time.&#160; I snapped more than I should have.&#160;&#160; There were definite moments where I could have used a step back to gain some perspective (enter the power song).&#160; 

I like the lyrics of the song, “Today is the day you have made, I will rejoice and be glad in it.”&#160; (Originally penned by the psalmist David).&#160; I want to rejoice in each day the Lord has made.&#160; Not just the days where I get everything done that I wanted.&#160; Not just the days that the kids got along beautifully.&#160; Not just the days where we relaxed and had fun together.&#160; I want to teach myself and my kids to rejoice in each day.&#160; To see each day as a gift from God, and no matter the circumstances we can rejoice in that day.&#160; 

Crank it up and rejoice with us today!!&#160;
