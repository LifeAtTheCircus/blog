...your son won't sit on your lap because your legs are "too spiky."  
My four year old son told me yesterday that my legs "are prickly like a cactus."  
You better believe I made sure to get up early enough to shave my legs before leaving for church this morning.  They are silky smooth now (a fact that my son _and my husband_ are both glad about).
