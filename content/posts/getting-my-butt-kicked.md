So, last March I ran a half marathon with my father in law.&#160; I trained for it and was proud of myself for actually preparing for that one.&#160; Then, as often happens after a race, I was on this “Race is Over” high or something like that and so I had nothing to push me to run.&#160; And so I put it off.&#160; And tomorrow, became next week, next week, became next month…. one year later and my treadmill has seen no action in over 365 days.&#160; 

Pathetic I know. 

So, I randomly decided last Sunday to do the 30 Day Shred with Jillian Michaels.&#160; I had bought the dvd over the summer and did it once, maybe twice. 

Seriously, Jillian is kicking my butt.&#160; I have never, ever, hurt so bad before.&#160; I think every muscle in my body except for maybe my calves is hurting.&#160; 

I am happy to report that I have done it for 5 days straight.&#160; I don’t think I have ever worked out for 5 days in a row before.&#160; Even when training for the 10 mile and half marathons, I was happy if I ran 2 or 3 times a week.&#160; But, every day?&#160; This is crazy talk.&#160; 

But, I am going to try for it.&#160; It’s my goal to do the shred for 30 days straight.&#160;&#160; I kinda feel like my body and my life needs a little boot camp action to hopefully kick my butt in gear, gain some muscle, lose some fat, and make working out a regular habit.&#160; That’s why I’m trying really hard to actually do it 30 days in a row.&#160; After that I’ll reevaluate and figure out a new goal. I need a goal. Without a goal, I let my treadmill sit idle for a year. 

I love that the work out is only 20 minutes long.&#160; It seems much more doable to squeeze 20 minutes into my day.&#160; Unfortunately, not being a morning person has meant that I tend to squeeze this in right around lunch time… which means I also have an audience.&#160;&#160; Which has been comical, to say the least.&#160; My 4 year old is cracking me up with her comments as she watches me work out and sometimes joins in.&#160; 

Day 1-&#160; “That’s it?&#160; I wanted to do more.”

Day 2-&#160; While getting changed into work out clothes she asks why I don’t just wear my sports bra and shorts like the girls on the video.&#160; 

Day 3-&#160; There are two girls besides Jillian leading the exercises.&#160; One is doing the more “advanced” moves and the other is doing the moderated moves.&#160; So we’re watching the advanced girl, trying to keep up with her and my daughter says, “Why is the other girl smiling?”&#160; “Me, b/c she’s having fun exercising.”&#160; “But, she’s losing, why is she smiling?”&#160; “She’s not losing, she’s having fun doing her best.”&#160; “Maybe she’s smiling b/c she doesn’t know she’s losing.”&#160; Oh dear…

Day 4- While doing the bicycle crunches “Mom, why do you scrunch your face up like that?”&#160; “Because it hurts”&#160; “Why don’t the girls on the video scrunch their face up?”

As you can see, she keeps me humble and makes me laugh which helps get me through the painful work outs.&#160; I keep wanting to get up early and exercise first thing in the morning, but I find when I wake up I am so sore it takes me awhile to get out of bed and moving… does this mean I am getting old?&#160; I have noticed that some days are easier than others… I’m hoping this means, I’m getting better.&#160; The girls keep asking when I’ll move to level 2.&#160; My goal is to try and get there after week 1.&#160; We’ll see…

Any of you ever shredded before?&#160; Does it get easier?&#160; Does it ever stop hurting?&#160;
