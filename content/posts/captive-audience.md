They say newborns don’t do much other than sleeping, eating, pooping, and crying.&#160; While that may be true, I gotta tell you the circus crew has not yet tired of watching their baby brother do these things.&#160; 

It’s been a week since we brought our little man home from the hospital.&#160; And every-single-time we have to change his diaper, one can hear a stampede of feet as the three of them race for a spot by the changing table to watch.&#160; They even brought a stool in there so they can better see.&#160; Need a paper towel moistened to wipe his bottom?&#160; No problem, there are 3 eager volunteers to help with that.&#160;&#160;&#160; My youngest daughter will eagerly grab a diaper from the basket and open up the tabs for me.&#160;

Their favorite thing to do with their baby brother is to hold him.&#160; Nothing lights up their face more than the opportunity to hold him in their arms.&#160; You can hear my son tell his brother all the things he wants to teach him when he grows up… how to read and write his name, how to throw a baseball, how to climb a tree…. he can’t wait for him to get bigger so they can play together.&#160; Meanwhile the girls want him to stay a baby forever.&#160; They love to hold his hand and snuggle up next to his face.&#160; Every time he makes a peep, they peek in to check on him in his bassinet or crib.&#160; When my 4 yr old returned from an outing with Daddy the other day, she quickly ran to check on her baby brother.&#160; She came out and lamented, “Momma, I think he got bigger while I was gone!”&#160; [![IMG_0088](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0088.jpg "IMG_0088")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0088.jpg)&#160; 

I love how this picture captures my younger daughter’s enthusiasm for holding her brother… I gotta tell you she looks like this every time it is her turn to hold him… Arms wide open with an eager look of anticipation on her face.

I love the way they love their brother.&#160; They loved him before he was even born and their love has only grown since he arrived.
