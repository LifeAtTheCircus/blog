My kids each have a blanket that their grandma made for them before they were born.&#160; Being the creative individuals that they are, they call them their “grandma blankets.”&#160; I know, ingenious, huh? 

The other day I was laying on my daughter’s bed when I had a realization.&#160; “Hey”, I said, “this blanket is my grandma blanket.”&#160; She laughed and thought I was joking.

“No,” I said, “this blanket right here was made for me by my grandma when I was a little girl, so it is my grandma blanket.”&#160; 

Later that day I came into my room and saw this.

Seems she realizes how special a grandma blanket is and thought I should sleep with mine.
