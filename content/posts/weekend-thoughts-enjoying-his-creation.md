When I spend time in nature, be it gazing at the waves crashing at the shore of the beach, beholding a mountain peak in all it's might, or gazing at a star studded sky, each time, I feel compelled to worship my Maker.&#160; 

Spending the day at the zoo this week, was no different.

Watching the giraffe reach his long neck out to grab a leaf and witnessing a huge polar bear plunge into a pool of water both&#160; caused me to reflect on the Creator of the Universe.&#160;&#160; This may sound trite to say, but I love His creativity.&#160; He didn't have to make so many different animals.&#160; He didn't have to put color into this world.&#160; Why did he make the beak in that bird multicolored? 

As I walked through the zoo this week with my family, I couldn't help but praise the Creator of all things.

Genesis 1:20-24

20 And God said, &quot;Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.&quot; 21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 God blessed them and said, &quot;Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.&quot; 23 And there was evening, and there was morning&#8212;the fifth day. 

24 And God said, &quot;Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.&quot; And it was so. 25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 

_**Weekend Thoughts:**_       
_My posts typically relate funny anecdotes about the happenings here at the circus. While my days are seldom &#8220;normal&#8221; enough to leave me without a &#8220;post worthy&#8221; moment, I use my last post of the week to highlight something a little more &#8220;thoughtful&#8221; and significant. If you had a thoughtful post from this last week, or choose to make a new one, please feel free to add a link in the comments section below. I&#8217;d love to hear what others are learning._
