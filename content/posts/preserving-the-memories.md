I think there is something about the age of 3 that makes kids say some of the cutest things.&#160; Lately, our 3 year old has been cracking me up and I have to write them down lest I forget…

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Last week Scott was playing catch with our oldest son.&#160; She of course wanted a turn as well.&#160; Scott said sure and then she said, _**“Dad, can I get closer to you when I throw the ball, since I am a girl?”** _ (Scott told her she could get closer, but not b/c she was a girl, but b/c she was younger).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I went to a baby shower for a friend of mine.&#160; She is pregnant for her 3rd child, but it is her first girl.&#160; My son asked why she was having a baby shower since she had already had babies.&#160; I told him that it was b/c this baby was a girl.&#160; “Oh, he said, so when you had ******** did you have a baby shower too?”&#160; I told him I did after she was born, when we found out she was a girl, my friends threw me a party and gave me lots of girlie clothes and things.&#160; Then my 3 yr old piped up, _“**Well, Mom, I know that you definitely gave me a baby bath when I was a baby.”**_

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yesterday we finally, FINALLY had some sunshine and warm air here in MD.&#160; The temps reached the high 80s and as we were driving home she announced, **_“Mom, I am B-O-V&#160; hot.”&#160;_** (we seem to have a little work to do on spelling… but hey, she’s only 3)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My kids love telling jokes and she doesn’t want to be left out.&#160; Sometimes however, she misses the punch line just a bit.

**_“Mom?”_**

what

_**“Aren’t you glad I didn’t say bananas?”**_

Some of my favorite times are when we all are sitting together as a family, belly laughing… I truly love this phase of our life and wish I could freeze time…hopefully, by writing it down… I can at the very least preserve the memories.&#160; Visit [Mary](http://notbefore7.blogspot.com) for more [tiny talk.](http://notbefore7.blogspot.com/2011/04/tiny-talk-tuesday_11.html)
