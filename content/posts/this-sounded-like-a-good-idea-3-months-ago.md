I saw this line on a tee shirt this weekend at the Annapolis 10 Mile and loved it.&#160; But, it cost $27 so I decided instead of buying the tee shirt, I’d make it my blog title.&#160; 

Yea, I was so excited when I signed up back in June to run this race with my high school friends.&#160; 

And somehow 3 months came and went and I ummm didn’t really train adequately for it.&#160;&#160; But, they did. 

So, I ran/walk/ran/walk/ran 10 miles this morning.&#160; 

And I finished. 

But, ummm that’s really about all I can say about that.&#160; 

Though I wrote two [weekend thought](http://lifeatthecircus.com/?s=weekend+thoughts) blog posts in my head as I plodded along, one foot in front of the other, which I will share with you all the next 2 Fridays.&#160;&#160; Because deep thoughts are born in adversity, right? 

Before:&#160; (minus Jami who was peeing at the time of this picture)

After: (minus Jen and Jake who left right after they finished so they could go and do nursery duty at church…amazing, huh, I went home and slept, they went to church and worked in the nursery).
