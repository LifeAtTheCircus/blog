Today was a big day in the life of sibling relations at the circus.&#160; 

Around my daughter’s third birthday, my strong willed, independent, knows what she wants toddler, morphed into a “_whatever big brother does, that’s what I want too_” little sister (she still kept her strong will however).&#160; Her favorite color went from purple to red (her brother’s fav color).&#160; For the past&#160; week she has been telling me how she wants a [Spiderman cake](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/20/my-little-spidey/) just like her brothers when it is her birthday.

But today things changed.

There was a face painting booth at our local grocery store today.

What?&#160; Your grocery store doesn’t offer free face painting?&#160; Man, how prehistoric!&#160; 

My son walked up and of course asked if she could paint Spiderman on his face.

Nothing earth shattering there.&#160; If you follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lifeatthecircus), you know we’ve been fully immersed in the world of Spidey here at the circus.

But, then&#160; it came time for my daughter to get her face painted.&#160; I was sure she too would want Spiderman.

When the lady asked what she wanted on her face, she replied “Dora”[![IMG_7383](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/img-7383-thumb.jpg "IMG_7383")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/img-7383.jpg)

Do you get the significance of that choice?&#160; Not only did she pick her own thing, but she went second.&#160; So, she actually picked something different than her brother!&#160; 

This is a huge banner day here at the circus!

My little girl has a mind of her own!

(Yes, it appears that I am celebrating the fact that now in addition to looking for all things Spiderman, I also get to look for all things Dora…I am celebrating commercialism at it’s finest).&#160; That’s ok, I’ll take it… I am just happy to see my little girl think for herself!
