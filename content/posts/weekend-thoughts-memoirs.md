I’ve mentioned [before](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/06/26/why/), that the [situation in Sudan](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/07/11/weekend-thoughts-shopping-for-sudan/) has been heavy on my heart lately.&#160; During my attempt to [do something about it](http://lifeatthecircus.com/shopping-for-sudan/), I felt it was of utmost importance to learn more about it.&#160; Recently, I decided to read some memoirs written by people who are from the region and whose lives have been affected by the atrocities.&#160; 

A few weeks ago I read Halima Bashir’s memoir of Survival in Darfur entitled 
[Tears of the Desert](http://www.amazon.com/Tears-Desert-Memoir-Survival-Darfur/dp/B001FA0L6C/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1249132490&amp;sr=8-4)
.&#160;&#160; I was drawn to read this book because Halima was born the same year as me.&#160; Here is a woman who is my exact age, and yet her life is drastically different than mine because of the location we were born in.&#160; 

Reading her first hand account brought the situation home to me in ways that a cnn article could not.&#160; It put a face and story to the grave statistics.&#160; 

One thing that I was struck by was the similarities of our lives.&#160; She came from a loving family.&#160; She went to school.&#160; She even had electricity and later in life a television.&#160; Yet, she endured horrific persecution because of her gender and skin color.&#160; The atrocities that she faced are truly unspeakable.&#160;&#160; She was considered less than a dog merely b/c of her ethnicity!&#160; And yet she was treated worse than any dog I’ve seen.&#160; 

I was impressed by her strength.&#160; She stood up for what was right when it cost her everything and everyone.&#160; She persevered when most would have despaired.&#160; She survived.&#160; 

As I read the book, I had to remind myself that this was true.&#160; This was a real person and these events were not exaggerated or imagined. 

As I seek to educate myself more of the events taking place around the world, I plan to seek out more memoirs.&#160; By reading another’s first hand experience, I can better sympathize and understand situations that are taking place.&#160; Next on my reading list is&#160; [A Long Way Gone : Memoirs of a Boy Soldier written by Ishmael Beah](http://www.amazon.com/Long-Way-Gone-Memoirs-Soldier/dp/0374105235/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1249132526&amp;sr=8-1).&#160; Much like Halima, Ishmael was born only a year after me and yet this life’s story is like nothing I have ever known.&#160;&#160; These stories are not easy to read, but I feel it is important for me to learn from their experiences.&#160;
