It became quite clear to us that our little man was ready to try solid foods when he started opening his mouth like a baby bird anytime we were eating with him on our lap.&#160; We couldn’t help but laugh when he started reaching out for Daddy’s fork, mouth wide open, just begging for a taste.

Here he is holding our Smores ingredients while on vacation… his poor pathetic face seems to be saying, “They aren’t even nice about it!”

Finally, this weekend we gave him his first taste of rice cereal.&#160; [![IMG_6381](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_6381.jpg "IMG_6381")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_6381.jpg)

He kept reaching out to grab onto the spoon&#160; and try and get more.&#160; 

I have to tell you that never, NEVER have I seen a baby so excited about solid food.&#160; He literally waved his arms in the air and kicked his feet with glee.

I can honestly say that of all my babies, he truly enjoys food the most.&#160; When I nurse him, he will actually pause and look up to flash me this big ol smile… it’s almost as if he is saying, “Thanks Mom!”&#160; 

And this was by far, the most receptive baby I have had when it came to feeding him “solids.”&#160; In the past the first feeding has typically been more ceremonious, _lets put the spoon up to your mouth, you can get a feel for the new texture, spit it back out and we’ll snap a hundred pictures or so of this great right of passage_. 

Not so with this one… true, he ended up wearing quite a bit of the 
rice cereal 
paper Mache, but part of that was honestly b/c he kept grabbing the spoon trying to shove more in.&#160; He actually finished the entire bowl and by the end all 5 of us were smiling and laughing right along with him.&#160; 

It was a precious moment that I will cherish and a sweet reminder to take joy in each bite of life.
