After spending many hours on the [sidelines](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/06/17/life-on-the-sideline/) watching her big brother play soccer or baseball, today my middle child had a chance to shine in a sport of her own…



















GYMNASTICS

And my fearless and [flexible](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/08/07/a-lesson-in-flexibility/) tumbler, LOVED it, much like I anticipated she would.&#160;

She told me at the end of class, “Mommy, I’m a gymnast!” 

Watch out [Shawn Johnson](http://gymnastics.about.com/od/gymnastics101/p/shawnjohnson.htm), the 2020 Olympics could be all hers!
