The kids and I started reading the Chronicles of Narnia a few weeks ago.&#160; I finished reading them 
[The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe](http://www.amazon.com/Lion-Witch-Wardrobe-Chronicles-Narnia/dp/0060764899)
 and we’re now onto 
[Prince Caspian](http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Caspian-Movie-Chronicles-Narnia/dp/0061231134/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1309455085&amp;sr=1-1)
.&#160; The truth is, I’ve never read these books before, so I am just as interested and captivated as my oldest son is.&#160; 

The other day during quiet time the oldest two kids started walking back and forth between their separate areas… eventually they asked if they could play quietly together and I let them as long as they stayed quiet.&#160; 

Quiet time ended.

The younger two woke up and still they played quietly downstairs. 

An hour or so later and they emerged…

 bringing with them The 4 Thrones of Cair Paravel.[![IMG_2845](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_2845.jpg "IMG_2845")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_2845.jpg)

I told them I wanted to take a picture and they said _they wanted_ me to take a picture so they could send it into [Lego Magazine](http://club1.lego.com/en-US/subscription/default.aspx?SkuId=9052b50e-271e-46d2-9abb-e1950f8cc438&amp;step=1&amp;CountryId=US).&#160; 

I’m so excited that they are enjoying these books, but more than that, I am excited to see their imagination go wild and watch them create things.&#160;&#160; It’s summer fun just as it should be.
