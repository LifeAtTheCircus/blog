One of the sweetest parts of my day is listening to my kids pray.&#160; I love to hear the things they are thankful for at the end of the day.&#160; It gives me a glimpse into the things they value most.&#160; I can only imagine the smile their heartfelt prayers bring to our Lord as He listens to the cries of their heart. 

Tonight as my daughter was praying she thanked God for many things and then said very specifically, “but I am not, not thankful for thunderstorms.”&#160;&#160; I love her honesty with her heavenly father.&#160; I must say that in listening to their prayers, I am quite guilty of not saying thank you enough in my day end prayers.&#160; While I am often quick to offer up my list of requests as my head hits the pillow, all too often I fail to stop and say thanks.&#160; 

One thing I hope to teach my children is the many aspects of prayer.&#160; Prayer is about more than offering up a wish list to God.&#160; It is an opportunity to commune with our heavenly father.&#160; One thing that helps me to remember this is by praying through the acronym **ACTS** (**adoration**-offering up our praises to God, **confession**-confessing our sins before God, **thanksgiving**-giving thanks to God, and **supplication**-presenting our requests before God).&#160; I hope to model and walk through all four aspects of prayer with my kids in their nightly prayers.&#160;&#160; We aren’t there yet, but it is my goal to start modeling and praying with them this way.&#160; 

_What are you thinking about this week?_ _Why not use your last post of the week to highlight something a bit &quot;deeper&quot; then the average Momblog fair?&#160; I’d love to read your thoughts.&#160; Please feel free to write and link up a&#160; “thoughtful” post below.&#160; You can write a new post or link up one you wrote earlier in the week._
