After years of research in my test kitchen, I have found that Krusteaz sugar cookie mix tastes better than any of the "from scratch sugar cookies" I have made.  

And not only do they taste good, but literally, you pour the mix, add water, and stir!!

This is crucial for me, because with my three preschoolers, Mommy needs to spend her time managing the flour and cutting out of the cookies, not measuring and mixing.

I have found that what works for me in these busy holiday days with my circus crew, is to prioritize and focus my energy on what really matters most to us.  Some times that means I make the apple pie from scratch because that is our favorite.  Other times we use the box mix, because our favorite part is playing with the dough and cutting out the cookies.

One last thing that works for me during this busy holiday season... we do things in chunks... today's task was baking the cookies...tomorrow we decorate.
