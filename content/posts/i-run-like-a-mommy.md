My son told me he knew what I should wear on a tee shirt.  He came up with this slogan out of the blue the other day.

 

_"I run like a mommy and my kids cheer all the time when I run_

_and my husband works so good like a dad, he's awesome!"_

 

I'm not exactly sure what it means to run like a Mommy.  

 

But after recently receiving the photos from the race photographers, I realized that I learned a valuable lesson at my [A10 race](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/25/we-did-it/) which I applied when running my [half marathon](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/10/14/that-much-anticipated-weekend-review/).   

 

No matter how tired and close to death you may feel,

Put on a happy face when you see the race photographers.
