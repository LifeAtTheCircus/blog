Since the Steelers don’t play until Monday night this week, and it was forecasted to be a beautiful afternoon, we declared today to be Pumpkin Day!    Thanks to a trip to Trader Joe’s last night we had pumpkin cinnamon rolls for breakfast before church and pumpkin ravioli for lunch.  (the cinnamon rolls were a bigger hit with the kiddos).  Then we crossed the Bay Bridge for some pumpkin patch fun on the Eastern Shore.
