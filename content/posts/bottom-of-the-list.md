Anyone want to guess what this picture shows....

That is the roof of our &quot;white&quot; Ford Escape.&#160; I guess you could say its been awhile since car washing made it to the top of the to-do list.&#160; 

You know it's time to go it again when your kid hears the term 'car wash' and responds with a giggle, &quot;You can't wash cars!&#160; That's silly!&quot;&#160; 

Ummm....yea...the last time we washed our car this is what my son looked like.

2 years later... the picture has changed somewhat.

And we've acquired a little more &quot;help.&quot;&#160; [![Daddy&#39;s helpers](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/daddys-helpers-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/daddys-helpers.jpg)

Seems the circus life has kept us a bit distracted over the past 2 years... Yes, I am embarrassed to admit the last time we washed our car was May of 2006.&#160; Our middle daughter is actually older then our son was that last time.&#160; Pathetic!

But now that we have such eager helpers, I am _sure_ we will make it out to wash them again before our son is in kindergarten.&#160; And maybe another 3 or 4 times before he is driving them? Maybe....
