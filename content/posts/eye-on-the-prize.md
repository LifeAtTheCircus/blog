Last weekend was our Cub Scout Pack’s Pine Wood Derby race.&#160; It is one of the favorite Cub Scout traditions.&#160; Scott and our oldest son worked hard on the car.

My son had one focus:&#160; speed

He wanted his car to be as fast as possible.&#160; Whenever they discussed designs or modifications, speed was always his deciding factor.&#160;

He designed his car to look like Bullet Bill from Wii Mario Kart.

Bullet Bill (the car on the right in the picture above) did well.&#160; He took second three times and first twice in the preliminaries. 

I love their faces on these next two pictures…. you can tell this was one of the times he took first.

In the finals, he ended up coming in fourth.&#160; So, he didn’t medal.&#160; This was a disappointment to them both, but after the race they were already talking about what they would do differently next year. 

Truthfully, I know he would have liked a trophy.&#160; But the real prize is in the memories they made this past week designing, shaping, building, and racing their car.&#160; That’s a prize that with time will not gather dust, but rather grow sweeter.
