I thought I'd share my 4 year olds favorite lunch sandwich with you all this week.  Those of you feeling a bit adventurous might want to give it a try.  You put peanut butter on one slice of bread, grape jelly on the other (nothing new here)  and in the middle you place a slice of cheese and a few slices of ham.  He invented it, he LOVES it and has eaten it every day for lunch for the past few weeks.  If any of you give it a try, please comment and let me know what you think!  As for myself, I think I will pass.  

For those less daring, here's our dinner plan for the week...

*   **Monday:** I am out (AGAIN) for dinner with the girls for a MOPS leadership meeting (Am I spoiled our what?).  My hubby is making fish fillets for him and the kids.  (I am so excited about this b/c I HATE fish and my husband wants to introduce the kids to it, so this seems like the PERFECT solution)!  

*   **Tuesday:** Since I was gone on Monday and we won't have properly celebrated Cinco de Mayo, we'll be having enchiladas for dinner with corn muffins and salad.  

*   **Wednesday:** My husband starts his summer Wednesday Night Sailing races today.  Since he won't be home for dinner the kids and I will have french toast.  Perhaps with a side of cottage cheese jello or applesauce to go with it.  (My son and I LOVE cottage cheese jello.  You take cottage cheese and put it in a food processor or blender to smooth out the curds, then mix in a box of jello mix...My husband and daughter can't stand it.)  

*   **Thursday:** Pepperoni Bread with a side salad (one of my husbands favorites)  

*   **Friday:** Chicken Tortilla Soup (I made this recipe a few weeks ago, got it off of a Menu Plan Monday and I LOVED IT) (more salad... I am trying to be better about eating our greens)!  

*   **Saturday:** Nothing beats Daddy grilling some hot dogs and enjoying the weather out on the deck  

*   **Sunday:** Since it is Mother's Day, I am letting Daddy and the kids take care of today... in the past he has grilled me a steak (my favorite) with a side of baked potatoes (He also reads my blog so this is a HINT ;-)).
