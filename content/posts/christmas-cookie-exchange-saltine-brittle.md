This year, I was looking for something simple and inexpensive that the kids could work together with me to make for their teachers.&#160;&#160; Too much to ask?&#160; I hoped not, but nothing was coming to me.&#160; 

And then I remembered this brittle that someone had brought to MOPS a few years ago.&#160; It uses saltine crackers.&#160; And you can pick up a box of Saltines at Aldi’s for 89 cents… which is perfect since I have to make gifts for SS and Bible Study teachers (times 3) plus neighbors and the tutorial teacher and “don’t forget my gymnastic teacher Mom!”

This recipe is delicious, kid friendly, and 
cheap
 inexpensive!

First, line a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan with aluminum foil. 

Then, have the kids lay the saltines out on the sheet.

Melt one cup of butter, 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla on the stove and let it boil for 5 min.&#160; 

Next, you pour this mixture over top of the crackers. Make sure you smooth it out so it covers all of the crackers.

Place in 350 degree oven until crackers rise and bubble. (approx 5 minutes)

Then pour a 12 oz bag of chocolate chips on top of the mixture. [![IMG_3935](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMG_3935.jpg "IMG_3935")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMG_3935.jpg)

Once the chips start to melt, smooth them over the top.[![IMG_3938](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMG_3938.jpg "IMG_3938")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMG_3938.jpg)

Then you can add chopped nuts on top.&#160; I decided to add Christmas sprinkles instead.

Refrigerate for one hour.

(Yes, I included a picture of the inside of my fridge.&#160; Lovely, huh?)

Then, you simply break it into little chunks and pieces like brittle.

I do caution you to check the bottom as you pull them up b/c I found sometimes the aluminum foil stuck to the bottom.&#160;&#160;

We stuck them in these cute little bags I picked up at Target…$2.99 for 12!&#160; This recipe made enough to fill 4 of these little bags and save a few little ones for us to taste test.

Heat butter and sugar to boiling. Boil 5 minutes. Line 8 x 11 inch jelly roll pan with foil. Place crackers in a single layer on the pan. Pour butter mixture over crackers.

This recipe totally [worked for me](http://www.wearethatfamily.com) because it provided a nice gift for my kids teachers that was inexpensive, easy to make in bulk, and most importantly, the kids could make it with me.
