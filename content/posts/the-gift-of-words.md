I am a words person.&#160; Always have been.&#160; I love cards, and notes, texts and e-mails.&#160; And I save them.&#160; Yup… every note Scott ever passed me in high school,&#160; every birthday card, Valentine card, anniversary card… I have them all in a box. 

So, it should come as no surprise, that when my kids start writing, I started hoarding those precious words as well.&#160; I know can’t save them all, but I do try to save the “significant ones”.&#160;&#160; Letters to their baby brother when he was still in my belly, family portraits drawn in crayon of stick figures, Mothers Day cards….I have a file in my filing cabinet as well as a few envelopes and shoe boxes stuffed with them.&#160; 

Recently, one of my children has developed a love of words as well.&#160; Now that she’s growing in her reading and her phonics, I am finding she’s taken to the pencil and paper in a manner that surprised me.&#160; 

Last month, I found a note taped to her door.&#160; It was written after she had been sent to her room for an outburst and&#160; it explained&#160; how she doesn’t always hate me but sometimes she does.&#160; As soon as I found it, I knew it had to go in my box of keepsakes.&#160; 

Odd, I know.&#160; But this is **my** box of keepsakes and I found the note significant for many reasons.&#160; 1.&#160; She used her words to express herself (this is something we’ve been working on for awhile.&#160; 2.&#160; The teacher in me was proud of the good use of phonics.&#160; 

Truthfully, I know she doesn’t hate me.&#160; And truthfully, I found the fact that she told me, “I don’t hate you all the time just some of the time”&#160; to be beautifully honest._&#160;_

 _(I didn’t read it like that at first, but when I reread it I realized it was an explanation for the hurtful outburst she had uttered downstairs)._&#160;&#160; And I pray that she can always be that honest with me.&#160; As long as it’s respectful.&#160; I don’t want my daughter to tell me what she thinks I want to hear.&#160;&#160; I want her to feel comfortable to tell me what she is really thinking and feeling.&#160; I want our lines of communication to be always open. 

So, after tucking the note away in a drawer to save, I went and spoke with her about what she was feeling.&#160; 

I’ve found a few other notes taped to her door since then, which have prompted some good discussions.&#160; 

But, this week, was my favorite.&#160; This week she decided to start writing me notes in a notebook.&#160; And we’ve been passing it back and forth at night.&#160; When I come up to bed, I have been delighted to find her little book waiting at the top of the stairs… filled with adorable phonetic writing, pictures and questions and observations on life.&#160; I eagerly write her back and place the book by her pillow.&#160; This note passing has gone back and forth for a few days now and her sister has also followed her example.&#160; So, I’ve been treated with 2 notebooks at the top of the stairs each night this week. 

I love LOVE this little glimpse into their minds and hearts.&#160; And I pray this dialogue continues.&#160; Seems like a safe place to ask questions and get answers.&#160; What a beautiful way to grow our relationships with some good old fashioned letter writing.&#160; AND to top it off, we’re working on reading, writing, and spelling just as an added bonus!&#160; The sentimentalist in me is thrilled that it is all being documented in a note book as well, because you better believe these books will be tucked away in my box of sentimental things when we’re finished. 

I don’t know how long this will last.&#160; I’d love to envision it going on for days/weeks/months… but they could lose interest tonight.&#160; I vow to answer as many as they write me though and I try to respond with some questions to keep the dialogue going.&#160; And for now, I am treasuring, truly treasuring these gifts of words and praying for a lifetime of open communication.&#160;
