I feel busy… these past few months have probably been the busiest I’ve been in quite awhile.&#160; Scott worked a ton of overtime, the oldest three played soccer, the girls both did gymnastics, my oldest son started piano lessons, cub scouts is back in action, the home school year began—it takes up way more of my day than it used to…. I am not complaining… I willingly signed up for all of these things (ok… except for the overtime part) and I enjoy them… it’s a stage of life for us that is fleeting, I know. And I am enjoying it. But it is a different stage for us … and it is busy. 

All that to say, I have sorta fallen off of the blogging band wagon.&#160; I keep saying to myself, “Oh I’ll blog that..” And then when the day is over, the kids are in bed and I sit on the couch with the computer in front of me… I draw a blank… or I don’t feel like writing anything.&#160; Those “good ideas” I had earlier have flown the coup and all I have is a blank screen and all I feel like doing is scrolling through face book, catching up on a show on the DVR, or reading a book…&#160; 

I know I am not destined to be a famous blogger.&#160; I am not going to get hundreds of hits a day or find myself speaking at a blog conference.&#160; I am “just another mom blog” of which there are thousands… and sometimes at the end of a long day/week/month I ask myself, “why bother?”&#160; “why do I blog?”&#160;&#160; And then I’ll look at the sidebar on my blog which posts links to old blogs and I’ll click over and I’ll remember days gone by that I had long forgotten… [vacations that I have yet to scrapbook](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/11/10/everglades-national-park/), [my favorite Halloween photos of my oldest daughter ever](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/11/04/super-girl-learns-to-fly/),&#160; oh my goodness… I totally forgot it wasn’t that long ago when [SHE was my baby!](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/30/i-scream-you-scream-we-all-scream-for/), and seriously when did [he grow up?](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/29/whats-up-doc/) (he used to always leave our house in one crazy costume or another… I forgot that)&#160;&#160; That is one reason I blog… **to preserve the present so I’ll have it to look back on later**.&#160;&#160; Another reason I blog is **to keep friends and family up to date** on the happenings here… We are so blessed to have my grandma and Scott’s Nana reading our blogs… It allows them to follow their great grandchildren&#160; in their day to day activities and antics, which they otherwise wouldn’t be able to do due to the fact that they live far away…. I also strive to blog as a way to **** [**“bring glory to the one who made me**”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVTeIMursb8)… and as an added bonus I’ve been **blessed to meet some new people** who I now consider friends and **to further develop some relationships** with people I knew in real life, but not as well as I’d have liked… 

And so, I am not giving up on blogging… but I am struggling to find my voice in this new stage of life and to find the time of day that I have the energy and distraction free time in which to do it.&#160; Thanks for being patient while I figure it out…

A few pics of life around here this week…
