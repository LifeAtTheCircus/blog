One of my hubby’s fav breakfast foods is my home made coffee cake.  I often make it for him on special occasions like Valentine’s Day, our anniversary, or his birthday.  

Because you can make it the night before, it is great to serve for overnight guests.  Or for freakishly early breakfast guests like I had this weekend.  My son had a 9:30 baseball game on Saturday and we had invited my husband’s extended family over for breakfast before the game.  Breakfast before a 9:30 soccer game translates to having kids dressed, table set, and breakfast ready by 8:00am.  

The only way that is possible at the circus, is if the main course was made the night before.  

Enter Nancy’s Sour Cream Coffee Cake.
