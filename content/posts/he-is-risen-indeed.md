While I have enjoyed the many ups and downs of our vacation to Texas, I have decided that I never again want to go on vacation the week prior to Easter.&#160; I was very careful when planning our trip to make sure that we would be with family for Easter so that we could go to church and worship our Lord.&#160; I didn’t want to be camping or in the middle of nowhere for Easter Sunday.&#160; I am certain we will have a wonderful and special day as we celebrate our Lord’s resurrection with them.&#160; 

But, being away on vacation this week, I’ve been kind of off the radar.&#160; I’ve been out of my routine and haven’t spent the time I would like focusing on and preparing for this special day.&#160; I would have loved to have done some Easter crafts and projects with the kids.&#160; I really feel like the crafts and projects help to create a sense of anticipation and excitement as well as focus on the day.&#160; We did read the Easter story in the hotel the other night on Good Friday.&#160; And we’ve been talking to the kids about how Easter is coming and why we are celebrating.&#160;&#160; While the same could be true if I had spent the week at home, I don’t feel like this year I have personally spent much time in preparing my heart for worship.&#160; I think that is largely due to missing church on Good Friday.&#160; The Good Friday service at our church is by far my favorite church service all year.&#160; I love the time spent focusing on confessing our sins and worshipping our Lord, who took the consequences of MY sin by dying on the cross.&#160; I love the visual reminder and the often creative approach our pastor takes in helping to personalize the message.&#160; He always drives home the fact that MY sins nailed him to the cross, that He died FOR ME.&#160; It blows me away time and time again.&#160; 

I’ve spent some time reflecting on that this evening as I sit at the computer while the house sleeps around me and I am glad for this quiet time.&#160;&#160; I hope I can keep a right perspective tomorrow as I scurry to get three kids dressed nicely and out the door while also visiting with our cousins and their two kids.&#160; I hope I don’t fret more over getting the girls hair just right then I do the condition of my heart as we prepare for worship.&#160;&#160; I hope I remember the reason for the season.&#160; 

He is Risen, He is Risen Indeed!&#160; I hope you join me today in worshipping our Risen Savior!!
