It’s been really neat to watch the bond between my oldest and youngest.&#160;&#160; Our baby was the answer to his older brothers prayers, as he longed to have a little brother.&#160; I’ll never forget the look of pure joy when he found out he finally had a baby brother.&#160;&#160; I know he can’t wait for the day when they can truly play together, but for now it is so neat to see the love between them blossom.&#160; 

Last night was proof that the love flows both ways.&#160; The baby is used to falling asleep at night with his big brother on the bed across the room reading his book.&#160;&#160; Last night, however, his big brother spent the night at a friends house.&#160; So, when we put the obviously tired baby into his crib, he had his baby, his pacifier, light on, door closed…but no big brother across the room.&#160; 

When we walked out of the room, he was quiet for awhile.&#160; Then he started crying… truly crying.&#160; This is something he never really does when we put him down.&#160; Typically, we put him to sleep and he will just lay quietly in his crib until he falls asleep.&#160;&#160; I went back after awhile to see if maybe he lost his pacifier or something.&#160; But, no he had everything he needed, yet he was crying.&#160; After taking him out for a drink and laying him back down, he again started crying, REALLY CRYING.&#160; 

We both suspected it had something to do with the big brother missing from the bed beside him.&#160; 

So, Scott laid him down on his brothers bed.&#160; He snuggled up and fell fast and sound asleep… for the entire night.&#160;

It was his first night not sleeping in his crib…

It simply melts my heart…
