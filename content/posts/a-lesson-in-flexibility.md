 I love our pediatric dentist office, for many reasons….the play gym in the waiting room, the sun glasses for the kids to wear while the lights shine in their eyes, the cool prizes the kids get to pick out, the pac man games they play between the cleaning and the dentist, but mostly for the people.

Without the kind and patient hygienists and dentists, the games and toys really wouldn’t matter.

They all are so great with the kids.&#160; They take the time to talk to them, to explain to them what they are doing and why and they _let them be kids_.

Really, how many dentists do you know that would clean teeth with two stinky feet in her face?&#160;

Yea, the circus crew knows how to put patience to the test. 

That would be my flexible three year old with her feet in the poor dentists' face.&#160; Not sure why, but when both the hygienist and the dentist had her sit back in the chair my daughter’s feet popped right up in the air as _natural_ as could be.&#160;
