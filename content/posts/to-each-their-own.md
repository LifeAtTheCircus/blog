Some people like the feeling of sand beneath their toes.&#160; I must say I do enjoy the squish of wet sand beneath my feet as the waves lap at my ankles.&#160; 

My children, however, have a whole different kind of love of sand.

One which truly baffles my mind.

 EVERY SINGLE TIME we visit our community beach, it’s the same routine.&#160; We drop our stuff in the sand and they make a mad dash for the water, they splash and play and swim and then, inevitably, they decide it’s time to hit the sand.

As in lay down with their wet selves on the sand and make “sand angels”[![IMG_2805](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_2805.jpg "IMG_2805")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_2805.jpg)

Being sure, of course, to flip and get both of their sides equally covered in sand

And to make sure they are fully, fully caked in the sand, they will pour handful upon hand full on top of themselves, [![IMG_2822](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_2822.jpg "IMG_2822")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_2822.jpg)

until they are covered in at least a solid inch or two of sand

And when they feel they’ve got it on them thoroughly, they’ll stand up, run into the water, and wash it off

Only, to run back out and repeat

Perhaps it’s their own version of a spa treatment with a little exfoliating scrub…or perhaps it’s just an excuse to get dirty, all I know is, it keeps them entertained for QUITE awhile and it typically results in a sandy bathtub when we get home.&#160; 

They couldn’t figure out why I didn’t want to join them.&#160; While I was happy to sit in the sand with my feet in the water, I was not so eager to roll around caking my body in dirty sand.&#160; Am I alone on this?&#160; Is it a kid thing?&#160; Thoughts?
