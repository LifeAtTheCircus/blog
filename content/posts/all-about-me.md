One thing my husband and I try to stress to our kids is that life is not all about them.&#160;&#160; We love them dearly, and pour much of our time, love, energy and attention out onto them.&#160;&#160; But, because we love them, we also try to teach them that life does not revolve around them.

We are a family of 
5&#160; 
soon to be 6.&#160; So, in a lot of ways this is a lesson that is taught early on out of practicality.&#160; We just can’t meet everyone’s needs all the time right when they think they should be met.&#160; Sometimes you have to wait.&#160; And sometimes you have to go to places and events that you may not want to go to.&#160; But, if you cry and throw a tantrum about either, you will calmly be told, “I am sorry you are disappointed and don’t like this, but life is not all about you.”&#160; 

With this in mind, I thought it was so funny the other day when my almost four year old said to me quite out of the blue, _“Mom, ya know, I wish life was all about me.”_&#160;&#160; I wanted to chuckle, b/c like I said it was totally out of the blue… it wasn’t like a few minutes prior we had discussed this.&#160; In fact, I think she was sitting on the potty, truth be told.&#160; 

I love her honesty.&#160;&#160; Truthfully, don’t we all wish the same thing?&#160; I know even in my roles as wife and mom, selfishness creeps in poisons my attitude and outlook.&#160;&#160; I often need to remind myself that life is not about me.

All that being said, she is quite excited about her birthday in a few weeks.&#160; Because birthdays at the circus are a big deal and they are a day when things get to be all about you.&#160; (Within reason of course as my son quickly pointed out the other day, even on your birthday it’s really all about God, not you).
