You all know that the really talented crafty genes somehow skipped over me in the family tree.&#160; My girls are not going to get their wedding dress sewn by their Momma like I did.&#160; In fact there is a lot of doubt as to whether or not they’ll ever get the pajama pants I set out to sew them a year ago.&#160; 

But, I think I may have stumbled across a medium which I can do, and do with confidence. 

hot glue

Don’t worry, I have no aspirations of hot gluing their pajama pants or anything like that, but I did however make 3 of these this week. [![IMG_6188](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_6188.jpg "IMG_6188")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_6188.jpg)

When I stumbled across a picture of one of these on pinterest _(don’t ask too many questions, I don’t fully understand it and def don’t utilize it fully, but I have seen some cute ideas on there),_ I instantly fell in love with it. 

It reminded me of the bouquet of freshly sharpened pencils that Tom Hanks writes about in You’ve Got Mail.&#160; _(LOVE that movie… one of my all time favs)_

So, I set out to make one for each of my child’s tutor for the first day of school.&#160; They both really liked it.&#160; 

But, I wanted one too.&#160; After all, I am their teacher too, right? 

Soooo Crystal the mom stayed up till 11:00 making this vase so that the next morning when Crystal the teacher went downstairs to the school room she could smile at her cute little teacher vase. 

Yes… that’s right I made myself a present and bought myself flowers.&#160; That’s not the point… the point is, if I, the genetically craft challenged girl can make this, than so can you.&#160; It took an empty spaghetti sauce jar (those Classico ones worked great), A LOT more pencils than I had originally estimated (yes a second trip to Target was required to finish my present) and hot glue.&#160; 

easy peasy lemon squeezy

Since I couldn’t find any directions on the picture I pinned on pinterest, I just went and googled “pencil vase jar” and found [this.](http://homemadeserenity.blogspot.com/2011/05/make-it-2-pencil-vase.html)&#160; So, if your looking for an inexpensive cute idea for a teacher, might I suggest you bookmark or pin this idea.&#160; 

Warning:&#160; even though this vase looks super cute on your homeschool table… it might heed you to remember that it is filled with water, and sitting on a table filled with important papers, and 3 children.&#160; One might want to move said vase to another location when you begin working if one didn’t want to stop everything to quickly grab your papers, put them on the floor, and wipe up water…_not that I would know from experience or anything…_
