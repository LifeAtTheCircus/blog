As I mentioned [last Thursday](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/30/most-congenial/), I attended a small Christian High School with only 44 students in my graduating class.  The school was small enough that you could play a Varsity sport without actually being good at the sport (granted I sat the bench, but still I earned a letter warming that bench) and the majority of the school was in the marching band.  Seriously, you were cool if you were in the marching band. I know what you're thinking... I was not a band geek and I am not in denial... believe me the cool place to be on a Saturday night was at a band competition (We didn't have a football team so we played in band competitions each Sat from the end of Sept until early Nov).  That's me with my Flugal horn (it was like a marching French Horn)  to the left of the girl in all white (our drum major).  Come on, just look at that hat, can't you tell we were all the rage?  When I tell people today about my days in the marching band, no one believes me.  At their school it was the athletes and the cheerleaders. I guess the difference at my school was that we were so small the athletes and cheerleaders could still be in the band...Hmmm since I wasn't an athlete or a cheerleader does that mean I really was just a band geek?
