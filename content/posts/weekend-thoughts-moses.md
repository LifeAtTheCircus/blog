This Thursday I began a new year of Bible Study with an organization called [BSF](http://www.bsfinternational.org/).   One of the biggest reasons I chose this study over others is that it has a children's program unlike any other I've seen.   My kids will be going through a preschool curriculum based on the same study I will be doing.  I am so excited about talking with my older two children about what _we_ are learning each week.

The topic for this year is the life of Moses.  As I read through my lesson this week on the overview of Moses's life, I found myself challenged.  Moses was described as a man of faith, prayer, humility, and courage.  One thing that my lesson pointed out was that he did not seem to posses this traits at the beginning of his life, but he learned them as he walked with God.  I am so excited as I start a new year, hoping that in May I can look back and see where the Lord has helped me to grow in this areas as well.  

The beginning of fall and "back to school" season often marks the beginning of new Bible studies in various churches and organizations.   What are you studying this year?  How do you hope to grow?   I'd love to hear about it!

_My posts typically relate funny anecdotes about the happenings here at the circus  but, I use my last post of the week to highlight something a little more “thoughtful” and significant. If you had a thoughtful post from this last week, or choose to make a new one, please feel free to add a link in the comments section below. I’d love to hear what you are thinking._
