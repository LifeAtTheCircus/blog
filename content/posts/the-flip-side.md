The thing that we most fell in love with when we first saw our new house was the back yard.&#160; We loved, LOVED the big, private back yard. 

Clearly, it was not the fall when we had our love at first sight experience.

We spent the entire day tackling that beloved backyard.

Thankfully, we also made time for a little fun in the leaves.

Leaves can provide a great back drop for some smiley pictures.

Believe it or not, we actually did put the camera away and got to work.

Done and Done.

Hooray!
