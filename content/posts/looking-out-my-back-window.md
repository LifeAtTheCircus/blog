I glanced out my back window on Saturday and saw this

Only,&#160; I didn’t just see this precious moment in time, but simultaneously, my mind flashed back to several other similar moments over the past 5 years….

One can’t help but notice a few things when observing these father/child bonding moments in the back yard. 

1.&#160; Believe it or not Scott, we’ve been VERY successful in growing grass in our backyard these past 5 years!&#160; Look at the dirt our son is mowing back in 2007!

2.&#160; While the girls seem to prefer following close in step to Dad while mowing, both sons take a “I’ll take this section, you take that one Dad” approach to the lawn mowing duties.&#160; 

Love those sweet moments of repetition… passages of time that remind you that while so many things change, some things stay the same.&#160;
