While you might think that the [potential pink eye](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/05/yea-so-apparently-licking-windows-is-not-a-good-idea/), [multiple ear infections](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/16/san-antonio-like-youve-never-seen-it/), and [laryngitis](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/10/it-was-the-best-of-times-it-was-the-worst-of-times/) would scare me away from ever taking the circus crew on another national park vacation, it doesn’t.&#160; Just call me crazy!

I’ll admit, parts of [our Texas vacation](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/03/ambitious-or-crazy/) wasn’t all we hoped and dreamed it would be. 

But, I am glad we went and eager to visit some [more national parks](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/11/05/one-too-many-park-signs/). 

So this afternoon I sat down to map out a potential trip to Florida. 

To see two incredible parks. 

Nope, probably not the two your thinking of… 

[Everglades](http://www.nps.gov/ever/) and [Biscayne](http://www.nps.gov/bisc/)

I am so excited…we’ll get to see alligators, manatee, sea turtles, porpoises, and much more.&#160;&#160; I think it is going to be incredible!

But, it’ll take approximately 18 hours to get there.

18 hours&#160; of driving with a then 6, 4, and 2.5 year old.

Yea… we’ll be needing to break that up a bit.&#160; 

No problem, I’ve already started on that… there’s a [national park in SC](http://www.nps.gov/cosw/) and of course [Chick-Fil-A](http://www.chick-fil-a.com) headquarters in Atlanta.&#160; I kid you not I have been dying to visit there for YEARS!&#160; I don’t care that is slightly out of the way.&#160; I am going to visit the home of the original chicken sandwich!!&#160; 

We’ll also be passing through a little town called Orlando.&#160; Ever heard of it?&#160; We do plan to take a Disney vacation one of these years.&#160; I think we’ll hold off a little longer though so all three kids can enjoy the rides and attractions.&#160; We are contemplating a one day stop at [Magic Kingdom](http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/magic-kingdom/).&#160; Any advice?&#160; Is it worth it for one day, or should we hold off and wait till we do the whole Disney experience?&#160; Would our time be better spent at Sea World?&#160; It sure would fit the maritime activities of the rest of the vacation.&#160;&#160; For those that have been, I would love to hear your thoughts on this.&#160; I’d also love your opinions on when the best ages are for Disney.&#160; I want to go when they aren’t to bashful and shy to want to approach the characters, but yet not too old that the magic is lost on them.&#160; 

I have been known to stop for lunch in Times Square, NYC on my way to a wedding in CT.&#160; I am not afraid of a little crazy.&#160; I’m willing to do a one day stop at Magic Kingdom on our way home from the southern Florida national parks. 

But I want it to be worth while.&#160; 

FYI… we’re way early in the planning stages… as in just started talking about it last night, but right now I am thinking spring 2010…wanna hit Florida before the humidity and mosquitoes set in.&#160; Is spring the&#160; best season?
