Since my son turned 4 I no longer require him to nap every day.&#160; But to 
keep my sanity
 ensure that he has some down time, I do require him to have a quiet, rest time in his room while his sisters are napping.&#160; Most of the time he ends up [![spiderman blog](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/spiderman-blog-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/spiderman-blog.jpg)falling asleep.&#160; Other times, he reads or plays with toys on his bed.&#160; On Monday afternoon he found a red pen in his room during this time and decided to&#160; transform himself into Spider Man.&#160; This is what I saw when I let him out of his room that day.&#160; Like the Spiderman hands?

&#160;

&#160; He's informed us that when he grows up, he wants to be Spider Man.&#160; He then asked me, &quot;What does Spider Man do?&quot;&#160; Since I am not exactly a comic book expert, I replied, &quot;climbs walls.&quot;&#160; He then asked Daddy if he will build him a wall for him to climb like Spider Man.
