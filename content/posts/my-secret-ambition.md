I’ve had a few shows over the past 10 years, that I’ve really loved.&#160; You know the ones where you connect personally with the characters in a manner some might find unhealthy?&#160;&#160; But, if I had to pick one, as my favorite (_I’d probably kick and scream begging you to not make me limit it to just one_)&#160; But, if I had to pick one, than I’d probably say it was [Alias.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285333/)&#160; I remember when Scott and I first started watching, the show was already a few seasons in (which is the best way to start watching a show b/c we watched the first 2 seasons on DVD).&#160;&#160;&#160; I don’t even want to tell you how quickly we blew through those 21 episodes, staying up way later than we should for _just one more_.&#160; 

I loved it.&#160; 

[Alias](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285333/) nights quickly became one of my favorite nights of the week, as we’d sit curled up on the catching watching Jennifer Gardner get the bad guys.&#160; 

And here’s where I offer you my secret confession.&#160; In my head, when I watched her strut around in those crazy outfits with her blue hair and high heel shoes, in my head, I thought, “I could so be her.”&#160; 

I know… stop laughing… please… 

But do you ever do that sometimes?&#160; Have this version of you in your head that is so way cooler and so waaaay unrealistic?&#160; It happens whenever I play volleyball too.&#160; In my head, I am suddenly this awesome athlete that dives on the ground hitting the ball up setting it perfectly for my team mate to spike on the other team.&#160; When in reality, I am just giddy if I actually make contact with the ball in an appropriate way (rather than say, getting hit in the face).&#160; Reality is often a cruel intrusion.&#160; 

But, back to me in my high heel shoes karate chopping the bad guys as I sneak off with the secrets of some terrorist organization.&#160; 

I am a sucker for anything CIA, FBI, or any other acronym with I in it.&#160; If it’s a redbox night and I’m picking and I see any of the above acronyms you can bet that’s my pick.&#160; “What’s the movie about Crystal?”&#160; “I don’t know some CIA thing.”&#160;&#160; My heart is racing as they sneak into the building to steal the secrets… I can’t believe it when they go snooping through the stuff while the people are in the next room… _How do they do that?_

Lately, my movie obsession has crossed over into my book reading as well.&#160; Last week I plowed through the first 4 books in the [Gallagher Girl](http://www.thegallagheracademy.com/) series.&#160; OK, here is where my obsession perhaps starts to get a little embarrassing, as it leads me back into the world of Young Adult Fiction.&#160; But, truthfully, I’ve found that I like young adult fiction. ([Hunger Games](http://www.thehungergames.co.uk/) anyone?)&#160; It’s clean which I appreciate and an easy read.&#160; Anyway, Gallagher Girls is a cute series about a top secret spy school for high school girls.&#160; A tad adolescent, I know, but by book 3 and 4 I found myself up past midnight with my little book light on eager to read on.&#160;&#160; This weekend, I read [a more adult CIA fiction book,](http://www.amazon.com/Loose-Lips-Novel-Claire-Berlinski/dp/0812967097) which I would describe as realistic fiction.&#160; It gave a much less glamorized view of the spy life than that I’d seen on TV.&#160; And while I did enjoy it, I found myself forlornly telling Scott, “I don’t think I have what it takes to be a spy.”&#160; 

Again, stop with the laughing.&#160; 

It’s always hard when reality comes intruding again.&#160; I had this really cool image of myself with this awesome cover (minivan driving stay at home mom) who could totally kick but with a handgun, keep cool under pressure, and karate chop better than [Daniel-son.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087538/)&#160; And truthfully, I find myself realizing, I could NEVER lie to my husband, spot a tail, or shoot a bad guy.&#160;&#160; But, I’d love to file their paper work.&#160; Now that would be a dream job!&#160;
