I really wanted to take the kids in to DC this spring to see the Cherry Blossoms.&#160; It’s not something we do every year, in fact, I think I’ve been only a handful of times in the 27 years I’ve lived in Maryland.&#160;&#160; But, this year, I thought it’d be fun to go and was thinking we might even have a free weekend during their peak blooms.&#160; 

But, thanks to the warm winter we had, they peaked early and there was NO chance of going during their peak week as it just didn’t fit with our schedules.&#160; We hoped to try this weekend, but the cold and rain didn’t make it seem worthwhile. 

So, today Scott called me at 11:30 and said, “What are we doing tonight?&#160; Wanna go to DC?”&#160;&#160; I had an hour and a half to pack up some dinner, gather stuff together, (shower) and pick him up at work and the oldest 2 from tutorial.&#160; I was so excited, b/c I had given up on seeing the blossoms this year and while we knew it wouldn’t be peak, we figured we could hopefully still see some.&#160; 

Once we arrived in the city we realized there really weren’t many blooms left, so we decided to make a bee line for the Natural History museum b/c I’ve been wanting to take the kids this year to see the mummies, dinosaurs, and butterflies (all things we studied in school this year).&#160; We had a little over an hour before it closed and were able to see all three exhibits!&#160; _(wahoo, 2 trips taken care of in one spontaneous outing)_

Since Scott’s dad works in the city, he met us and we enjoyed a picnic dinner on the mall looking at the Capital and Washington Monument.&#160; _(can you tell we had them looking into the sun for this picture?)_

The big 3 actually enjoyed sitting on a steam vent for the metro.&#160; It was nice and warm as the cool evening air blew in.&#160; [![IMG_2970](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2970.jpg "IMG_2970")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2970.jpg)

_I tried not to think too hard about the smog and pollution that was blowing up on them and their food._&#160;

Like I said, most of the blossoms were off, but we did enjoy walking around the tidal basin at sunset and we did see _some_ blossoms.&#160; It was also peak season for the tulip garden which was beautiful!

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We were so excited to find a tree in bloom.&#160; Daddy and Pop hoisted the girls up on their shoulders so they could get a picture with the blossoms.&#160;

What a wonderful way to start the week… with a spontaneous afternoon in the nation’s capital with the family.&#160;
