I gotta confess from the start, this is not quite Wordless.

As I was tidying up the house during nap time this week, I found this in my kitchen.  I bent down to pick them up and decided to snap a quick picture first.  Because some day, my kids will be grown and in school, and I won't find half dressed baby dolls lying on the floor beside toy guns with my vacuum attachment stuck on top to turn it into a light saber.  And when I sit alone in my clean and quiet house waiting for my teens to buzz in the door between school, and jobs, and sports, I know I am going to think back to these days (you know the ones with toys covering the floor, and Cheerios in the couch cushions)  And I will miss them, immensely.

So this picture is to remind me to cherish these fleeting days and to savor the time by playing baby doll, and ball, and army, all while cooking dinner and tidying up the house.
