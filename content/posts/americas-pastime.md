I clearly remember the first baseball game I attended with Scott.&#160; A coworker had given him the tickets and since we had no plans, we thought, “Sure, why not?”&#160; 

As we drove into Baltimore and hit traffic, Scott was in disbelief, “Could this be game traffic?”&#160; He asked.&#160; “I had no idea this many people liked baseball.”

Yea… clearly, we aren’t big baseball enthusiasts.

But, thanks to my oldest son, my children are.&#160; So, we try to get to at least one game a season. 

Last week we took the circus crew to Camden Yards.&#160; And, truly, it was one of my favorite nights of the summer.&#160; [![IMG_2096](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG_2096.jpg "IMG_2096")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG_2096.jpg)

Sometimes, you try and do nice things for your kids and it ends in whining and fighting, tears, and Mom and Dad wondering “Why in the world did we bother?”&#160;&#160; 

 Thankfully, this wasn’t one of those nights. 

The kids were singing a rousing rendition of “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” the entire way from the parking lot to the ticket office.&#160; I couldn’t help but smile at their enthusiasm.&#160; They were even greeted with a round of applause from the ticket booth.&#160;
