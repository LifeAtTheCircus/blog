On Friday night we took advantage of the aquarium’s last discount priced Friday night of the season and enjoyed some family fun.

We took 293 pictures during our 3 hours at the aquarium.&#160; From those we narrowed down 42 keepers.&#160; [![IMG_6742](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6742.jpg "IMG_6742")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6742.jpg)

And from those, I have the difficult task of dwindling down some for the blog. [![IMG_6877](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6877.jpg "IMG_6877")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6877.jpg)

The kids favorite part of the evening was the dolphin show. [![IMG_6853](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6853.jpg "IMG_6853")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6853.jpg)

Scott and I were mesmerized by the new Jellyfish exhibit.&#160;

I easily could have spent more time watching them.&#160;

According to my son, there were 2 types of fish we saw that night. 

Keepers&#160;&#160; 

and&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Not Keepers

Every time we saw a little fish he’d say, “That’s not a keeper!”&#160; And anytime we saw a big fish, he’d get so excited and say, “There’s a keeper for sure!”

Big brother provides a help up for a better view![![IMG_6808](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6808.jpg "IMG_6808")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_6808.jpg)

I think the sharks were everyone’s second favorite attraction.&#160; We truly enjoyed standing and watching them swim by.&#160; Again… so thankful for that glass!

And the now traditional, classic aquarium family shot.
