We took the kids to the county fair last week.   Being the suburbanites that we are my kids don't get many opportunities to see livestock up close and personal, so we make a point of going every fall to see the cows, ducks, chickens, goats, sheep, and pigs.   Since we don't exactly live in the country, it's not quite as big as I'm sure some county fairs are, but a fun learning experience none the less.

A calf nursing.  And as I looked over at it I thought to myself how I could relate with that poor mama cow as the life was being literally sucked right out of her in front of [the whole world.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/21/my-longest-15-minutes/)  But then I watched the little calf head but it's mama as he nursed.  REPEATEDLY.  My husband laughed because he said my mouth just hung open and it was quite obvious the feelings of sympathy that were running through my mind.   My nursing days are through for now, but I'll think twice before complaining to anyone about the discomfort.  While I often did eat my meal while nursing, I NEVER had to go to the bathroom while nursing (yes, see that nice deposit down there by mama's feet, my [poop loving kids](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/09/15/are-we-alone-on-this/) got a kick outta watching that action) and thankfully I wasn't head butted repeatedly during the process.

I think I'll just put this picture in my scrapbook instead and keep the anecdote between me and you.
