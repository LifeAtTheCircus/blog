My youngest was sitting on the floor “reading” his choo-choo book to our dog Maggie when I had to grab my camera and snap a picture.&#160; 

He then looks over at me and says, “Aww man, No SMILE!”[![IMG_6240](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_6240.jpg "IMG_6240")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_6240.jpg)

I said, “Ok, no smile.” and he happily went back to his reading. [![IMG_6242](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_6242.jpg "IMG_6242")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_6242.jpg)
