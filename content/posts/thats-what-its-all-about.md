As we were getting ready to go to the [tree lighting ceremony](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/05/my-how-12-years-has-changed-things-a-bit/) downtown my son asked, _"Mom, can I tell Santa that he is **not** what Christmas is all about?"_ 

I love that as we anticipate Christmas, my kids know that we are preparing to celebrate Jesus' birth.  Yes, they know we are going to have presents under the tree, and they even sat on Santa's lap at Scott's work party, but when I asked my son what he likes best about Christmas, he answered, "celebrating Jesus' birthday."  This warms my heart, because the lights, the tree, the songs, the cookies, the presents, the pageants...all of them are meaningless traditions without Christ.  

  




 

But it's about much more than just the Christ child being born in the stable.  Because without the cross that too would be meaningless.  If you'll bear with me, I have yet another video clip to share.  I'll put the lyrics below so you can read them as well.  This song was on the [Go Fish](http://www.gofishguys.com/cms/pages/the-music/snow.php) Christmas CD I bought for my kids this year and it's become one of my new favorites.  With 5 days left till Christmas, as we scurry around to finish shopping, cleaning, cards, baking and fitting in all of the traditions, let us not forget to take time to reflect on what it is really all about.

  


 

It's not just about the manger  
Where the baby lay  
It's not all about the angels  
Who sang for him that day  
It's not just about the shepherds  
Or the bright and shining star  
It's not all about the wisemen  
Who travelled from afar  
Chorus:  
It's about the cross  
It's about my sin  
It's about how Jesus came to be born once  
So that we could be born again  
It's about the stone  
That was rolled away  
So that you and I could have real life someday  
It's about the cross  
It's about the cross  
Verse 2:  
It's not just about the presents  
Underneath the tree  
It's not all about the feeling  
That the season brings to me  
It's not just about coming home  
To be with those you love  
It's not all about the beauty  
In the snow I'm dreaming of  
Repeat Chorus  
Bridge:  
The beginning of the story is wonderful and great  
But it's the ending that can save you and that's why we celebrate  
It's about the cross  
It's about my sin  
It's about how Jesus came to be born once  
So that we could be born again  
It's about God's love  
Nailed to a tree  
It's about every drop of blood that flowed from Him when it should have been me  
It's about the stone  
That was rolled away  
So that you and I could have real life someday  
So that you and I could have real life someday  
It's about the cross  
It's about the cross
