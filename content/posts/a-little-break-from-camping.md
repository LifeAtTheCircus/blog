After our morning at the beach, we were headed north west to prepare for the next leg of our trip.  But before heading to 4 more National Parks, we were in need of hot showers, soft beds, and a washing machine.  

 

Enter, Best Western.

We hadn’t booked a hotel in advance because we weren’t exactly sure how far we’d want to drive on Friday… we knew we wanted to get close to Sequoia National Park.  As I searched online during our drive, I really wasn’t finding much in the town we had been aiming for, so we searched a little farther back… we found a Best Western 45 minutes from the park.

We stopped and were able to get the last room in the hotel!  Later when we went down to get quarters for the laundry, we spotted this sign. 

 

What a blessing!  We are fans of Best Westerns because kids can stay free in existing bedding… so if we don’t ask for extra towels or pillows or a roll away, we don’t have to pay for the extra occupants in our room.  AND, they have free breakfast.[![434 (2)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bwydUUwvjRE/V5mw3u_X37I/AAAAAAAABok/mCXbIaEv0pE/434%252520%2525282%252529%25255B3%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800 "434 (2)")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-A7XcwLhC4SY/V5mw3c8JDkI/AAAAAAAABog/4zabYI3CvkQ/s1600-h/434%252520%2525282%252529%25255B6%25255D.jpg)  

 

This hotel stay was just what we all needed.  I was able to do 5 loads of laundry and reorganize all of our clothing.  The kids had the pool to themselves.  They happily swam while Scott went out and got dinner.  

 

 

We then enjoyed taco bell and ice cream pool side, followed by watching the sunset while dangling our feet in the hot tub.

We took our time getting up and out the next morning, and stopped at the grocery store to stock up on food for our next two days of camping.
