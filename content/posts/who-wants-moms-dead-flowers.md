On the wall in my bedroom, tucked away in the corner on my side of the bed is a shadow box in which I pressed some dried flowers from my wedding bouquet.&#160;&#160; I’ll confess I don’t look at it often, but when I do I smile and remember that special day. 

My children, however, don’t share my sentimentality. 

The other day my 5 yr old and I were sitting on my bed and she said, “Mom, why do you have those old dead flowers hanging on your wall?”&#160; I told her that Daddy had given me those flowers on our wedding day.&#160;&#160; I of course thought this obviously answered her question.&#160;&#160; But she looked up at me like I was crazy and said very matter of factly, “But now they’re dead.”&#160;&#160;&#160;  _(as in so why do you have them hanging there now Mom?)_ It was then obvious to me that she thought her mom was crazy for hanging dead flowers on her wall.&#160; I then remembered the conversation I had with her brother a few years ago when he asked me why I had poop hanging on my wall.&#160; I told him it wasn’t poop, they were dried flowers from my wedding.&#160; “Oh,” he replied, “they look like poop to me.”&#160; 

Something tells me 50 years from now when the kids are cleaning out our house and divvying up our our belongings, none of them are going to be fighting for the right to take mom’s dead flowers to their homes.&#160;
