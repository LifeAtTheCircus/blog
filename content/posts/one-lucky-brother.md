As I watch my kids play together, I can’t help but think how my son has no idea how good he has it.&#160; Growing up, it was just me and my little brother and we’d often play together.&#160; I vividly recall playing GI Joe with him.&#160; It pretty much went the same way every time.&#160; I had the Princess Lea action figure and she would be married to either Shipwreck or Sgt Slaughter.&#160; I’d let him go off on the side and fight his battles or whatever while Princess Lea would clean house and make dinner.&#160; Then she’d call him home from war to sit at the table and eat his dinner. 

Yea, I pretty much turned Joes into Ken and Barbie. 

Lately, my oldest two have been playing GI Joe and it is a totally different game.&#160; My daughter is Lady Jaye and she throws grenades across the toy room at the Cobra’s.&#160; 

I couldn’t help but chuckle when she came looking for a sack to wear on her back for her grenades to go in.&#160; Yea… my son totally struck gold in the sister department.&#160; Sorry bro!
