 When things didn’t work out for us to go camping this weekend as planned, we promised the kids a night of “camping-like” fun at home.&#160;&#160; Scott came home from work a little early and we cooked up hot dogs and baked beans (a fav here at the circus). 

Then we spent the evening fishing on the river.

(more details on the fishing to come later this week)

Camping wouldn’t be complete without Smore’s so we roasted some mallows over the gas stove.&#160;

Then we came home and let the kids camp out downstairs in a tent in the toy room.

Sometimes things don’t go as first planned, but many memories can still be made, if you think outside the box a little.
