The time is 11:45pm.&#160; One tired hubby is doing his best to fall asleep so he can get up the next morning and go to work and provide for his family.&#160; Meanwhile his “endearing wife” keeps him awake chattering away about the fun festivities she has planned for the following week.

Because he is a good man, he kindly listens as I tell him about National Pancake Day and why it is celebrated, when I know that truthfully, he wants nothing more than to roll over and fall asleep.&#160;&#160; _OK so maybe there is one thing he’d like more than that, but I can guarantee you it had nothing to do with pancake day…_

In case any of you, like me, get a little too excited over totally frivolous holidays, I thought I’d share with you the fun plans we have for this week at the circus.&#160; While the circus dad patiently listened to my mid night ramblings, he couldn’t quite match my childlike enthusiasm.&#160;&#160; It really is the little things that make me giddy.

Did you know that Tuesday is National Pancake Day?&#160;&#160; [IHOP is giving away free short stacks of pancakes](http://www.ihoppancakeday.com/) in honor of the occasion.&#160; Rather than braving the crowds at IHOP though, I plan to serve chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast at home, and crepes for dinner.&#160; I am even considering making [this recipe](http://www.world-of-crepes.com/beef-burgundy.html) to make the crepes&#160; a bit more dinner like.&#160;&#160; I have&#160; a feeling the kids will opt for PB&amp;J crepes instead though. 

But the fun doesn’t stop there.&#160; Wednesday, is [Read Across America](http://www.nea.org/readacross) Day and Dr Seuss’s birthday.&#160;&#160; We are going to have Green Eggs and Ham for dinner.&#160; We’ll also do a few [Dr Seuss coloring pages](http://www.seussville.com/special/read.html) and I plan to have everyone put their pjs on before dinner and after dinner we’re going to all snuggle up in the living room and read… I have visions of a few read alouds as well as a little SSR with classical music playing, pillows on the flour and perhaps some popcorn to much on…. doesn’t it sound delightful?&#160; Isn’t it obvious to see why this circus mom couldn’t sleep?&#160; I am sure it will go flawlessly without any grumbling or arguing or any other circus like antics to break the magical spell.&#160; _&#160; ha-ha…. a mom can dream, can’t she?_

How about you?&#160; Any fun plans for the week?&#160; Care to join me in celebrating pancake day and or Dr Seuss’ birthday?
