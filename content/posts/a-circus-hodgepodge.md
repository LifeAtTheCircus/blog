I have been going non stop the past several days.&#160; Friends over for dinner, going to other friends homes for dinner, attending a party, hosting a surprise party…it has been social function after social function for 5 days straight.&#160; I have enjoyed each experience greatly, but I am an introvert and after spending time with people I need time alone to recharge.&#160;&#160; I have one more event tonight (a MOPS Family Fun Night at our church…being as I am the coordinator, I need to be there and be fun).&#160; Tomorrow I have big plans of staying home all day to recharge my batteries.&#160; The kids and I are going to make snowman foods, watch Frosty and do some crafts.&#160; Just us.&#160; I am looking forward to it greatly.&#160; Somewhere in there I also need to do some laundry b/c if you knew what my poor husband went through to find a presentable outfit this morning to wear to his presentation, well, if you knew than you would know that I will not be nominated for woman of the year anytime soon.&#160; Somewhere in the mad dash to find clean work clothes, I uttered the phrase, “Hey, I found matching socks… that’s good right?”&#160; Yes, a good indicator that you are at a low point.

And in the midst of all this “socialness”&#160; I have been absent from blogland.&#160; Typically the weekends are quiet time for blogging.&#160; Not this weekend…&#160; I leave the blog roll for a few days and come back to find that Monica’s husband is on his way [home for R&amp;R](http://dailydwelling.com/our-plans-for-r-r-leave), Rebecca was out for a week due to the cold and [returned as Martha Stewart](http://ahappyheart-rebecca.blogspot.com/2009/02/blogging-and-baking.html), Jessie [goes to Ca](http://mutheringheights.blogspot.com/2009/02/part-one-ho-for-california.html) and sees Kirk Cameron, and M. has made it to her [100th post](http://homegrownstrawberries.blogspot.com/2009/02/100.html) already!&#160; 

I have had so many thoughts and post ideas rolling around in my head and yet when naptime is here and I have a chance to sit and compose I am finding it difficult to formulate it all.&#160; I have some funny kid anecdotes which I just may collect together in a a post if for no other reason than to ensure I “write” them down so I don’t forget them.&#160; 

[![IMG_4231](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/img-4231-thumb.jpg "IMG_4231")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/img-4231.jpg) I’ll leave you with two pictures from the weekend.&#160; This is the kids trying to keep Scott from going to work on Saturday.&#160; As he picked our youngest up to hug her goodbye, the older two grabbed his legs to try to keep him from leaving.&#160; Sometimes they hide his keys or wallet or badge in the morning.&#160; Scott and I will be scrambling around the house looking for them and then out of desperation ask the kids if they’ve seen Daddy’s keys only to have them go and pull them out from under the couch cushion where they hid them.&#160; When we ask why they did that they reply, “so Daddy couldn’t go to work.”&#160; Some mornings it is quite cute and endearing…other mornings when he is late for a meeting it is a little less cute.&#160; 

And my last picture will also not earn me the “Woman of the Year” award.
