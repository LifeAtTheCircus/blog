After two long days in the van, we took a welcome respite at our friends Bob and Judi’s house in Albuquerque, NM.&#160;&#160; In fact, we pushed through and made Sunday such a long day on the road, so that we could spend the entire day with them on Monday. It was fabulous. 

They have a daughter who falls in age in the middle of our oldest two children.&#160; She got along wonderfully with all 4 of our kids though.&#160;

The kids enjoyed a low key morning of fort building and playing around the house.

After lunch we had a little down time, followed by the afternoon at the pool.&#160; Then we were back at the house for a delicious Mexican dinner. The views from their house were stunning.&#160; You can see the mountain ranges from their back windows.&#160; [![IMG_0688](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0688.jpg "IMG_0688")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0688.jpg)

Their back yard was a beautiful desert garden.&#160; I was really taken with the differences in architecture and flora in the southwest.[![IMG_0690](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0690.jpg "IMG_0690")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0690.jpg)

And of course the desert view sunsets. [![IMG_0696](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0696.jpg "IMG_0696")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0696.jpg)

We ended the day with a game of soccer at the park at sunset.[![IMG_0719](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0719.jpg "IMG_0719")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0719.jpg)

After a relaxing and refreshing visit with friends we are set to embark on phase two of our grand adventure… the camping/National Park portion.&#160; Today we have one of our last “longish” days on the road (a little over 7 hrs) before we set up camp tonight in Tuscon, AZ at Seguaro National Park.
