I feel like the month of August is much like the 9th month of pregnancy.&#160; I go into crazy nesting mode as I gear up for another school year.&#160;&#160; There is the ordering of curriculum… then the purchasing of school supplies… then the organizing of the binders… and cracking open that homeschool cabinet which ALWAYS turns into the junk closet over the summer.&#160; _Ya know, the “Company is coming and I need a place to hide all these papers and misc junk from the kitchen counters,”&#160; place…._ 

Then in addition to all of the school prep, I go into crazy nesting mode on the house… deep cleaning and purging and organizing… b/c much like in pregnancy, I know free time is going to come to an end soon and it will be ALL I can do to keep dishes washed, clothes washed and groceries bought… scrubbing the bath tub and mopping the floor typically fall to the wayside until the next school break. 

And so I clean and organize and do all I can to prep for the new year. 

This year I have spent a GREAT amount of time and thought into changes I want to incorporate into the new year.&#160; I intend to be way more structured this school year than in years past and I’ve been trying to work out the best system for that.&#160; I think I have it figured out.. it will take a few weeks to see if I need to adjust the schedule any.&#160; 

We started back with school at home this week.&#160; We did math, spelling, handwriting, memory verse, typing, flashcards, reading and art.&#160; It’s been kind of nice to have a week of adjusting back to school without our FULL back to school schedule.&#160; It has helped iron out some kinks and give me some time to do more prep work.&#160; Next week the tutorial starts back officially and we will add Latin, History, Science, Grammar, and Writing to our school day assignments.&#160; I am both excited and nervous.&#160; I will have a 5th, 3rd, and 2nd grader this year.&#160;&#160; I also have a “very eager to start learning”preschooler.&#160; I think this will be my hardest year yet of homeschooling, which is why I have spent weeks trying to plan and organize and set things in place. 

Our first day was rough.&#160; There was literal weeping and gnashing of teeth.&#160;&#160; But, we plowed through and day 2 was MUCH better.&#160; 

I think I will need to take it one day at a time… and I think I am going to need to bathe the year and each day in prayer.&#160; Patience and discipline and perseverance are going to be needed… and I know I can’t rely on my own strength for any of that.
