We keep our digital “point and shoot” camera on the counter.&#160; My 5 year old calls it “his camera.”&#160; He has permission to run and grab it to snap photos when something catches his fancy.&#160; [Every now and then](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/03/18/through-the-eyes-of-my-soon-to-be-5-year-old/) I’ll download them and enjoy a glimpse of life around the circus through the eyes of my eldest.&#160; 

He was so excited about this puddle that he found on the deck a few weeks ago.&#160; He had Daddy stand and guard it so his sister’s didn’t destroy it until he snapped a picture.&#160; Can you guess what animal he saw?

I love the fact that when you look at this picture you can tell it was taken from a photographer who was under 4 ft tall.&#160; I also love that we are off centered… it makes me smile.

His beloved birds and the nest he built for them last week.

Here his little hobby came in handy in getting Mom’s attention when his little sister was getting into trouble.&#160; I hadn’t noticed her mischief until I saw him grab his camera.&#160; [After grabbing mine](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/06/18/making-jam-circus-style/), I got her off the table!

Isn’t that the coolest strawberry you’ve ever seen?&#160; I thought it looked like a star, he sees a butterfly.&#160; What do you see?

Our little photographer himself.&#160; Gosh, how I love that smile of his!
