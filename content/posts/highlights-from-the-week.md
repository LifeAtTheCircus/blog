 A few pics to sum up the week and highlight a few of my favorite moments.

My favorite part of our home schooling day is the beginning.&#160; We start with the pledge and a very loud and off key rendition of The Star Spangled Banner.&#160; Warms my patriotic soul!

Q: What do home schoolers wear to school?

A: whatever they want.. ie leotards and camos

We made a discovery this week.&#160; The kids like board games.&#160; And better yet, they are finally at an age where they can all follow the scope of the game and play for real.&#160; It has made playing so much more fun, though _I still attest that Shutes and Ladders is the worst game ever!_

I was reminded this week of how much the kids love to hold their brother.&#160; Too often I am rushing from one thing to the next and don’t take the time to let them enjoy him.&#160; I gave each of them a lil time to hold him.&#160; Their faces lit up with joy and I realized that slowing down for a minute or two was well worth it.&#160;

Hmm…any one care to guess what we had for dinner that night?

I don’t have a picture of this, but Wed I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with my to do list.&#160; I could feel the stress level rising so I turned on some praise music while the kids went out back for recess.&#160; It was still on during lunch and as I held my sweet baby the song _Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus_ came on.&#160; One by one we all started to sing a long.&#160; It was just one of those truly sweet, savor it, kinda moments.&#160; Rocking my baby and praising my Lord with my children….

   









 

My entry way is a mess.&#160; The kids clothes need to be sorted and switched for the new season.&#160; I haven’t been grocery shopping and I still have 4 loads of laundry to fold and put away…..but in the midst of that, even though I am far, far from caught up, we’ve had some precious moments this week which I can look back on and they make me smile.
