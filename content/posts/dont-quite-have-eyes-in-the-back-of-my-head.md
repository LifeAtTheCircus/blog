Ya know how they say Mom's have eyes in the back of their head? I'm not sure exactly when my extra set will arrive... do my children have to reach a certain age, or do I need to have a certain number of children? Seems that with a 4 year old, a 2 year old, and an almost 1 year old... I could really use those extra set of eyes...NOW!

Here is a video clip I took 1 month ago of my baby girl playing with a sword. Yes, when you have a big brother you grow up accustomed to [such weaponry](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/19/bad-guys-beware/). I was actually on the phone with my mom when I saw her playing with the buttons on the TV and got out the camera. You can hear I was quite taken with her, cooing at her and what not. But, pay careful attention to what is going on behind me. That's right... look at the reflection in the TV behind her, there you will find the real nugget in this home video. Thanks to my hubby for the slow motion replay at the end of the clip.

Yes, that would be my son leaping from couch to couch.&#160; See him running and jumping on my furniture?&#160;&#160;&#160; Until reviewing the video this week I was completely oblivious to the shenanigans that had gone on behind me.&#160; Guess this circus mommy isn't quite as good at multitasking as she thought!&#160; So, while I am having a precious little video session with my baby sword fighter, it seems there is a whole other circus act going on behind me.&#160; Wonder if that is what my baby is babbling to me about?&#160;&#160; Yup, I definitely haven't reached the &quot;eyes in the back of my head Mommy status&quot; yet. Not sure where I need to go to pick them up, but I need them soon, before my kids realize the extent of Mommy's oblivion.
