Our middle child really likes to put things in order.  Before she goes to bed at night she puts each of her stuffed animals in a straight row beside her pillow.  I've noticed recently that she seems to gravitate towards put things things into straight lines.  When she plays with blocks she puts them next to each other in a row, like a road, rather then stacking them one on top of the other.

When we were done eating the adults were all talking and the kids were playing.  We looked over and our little organizer had rearranged the chairs.

Each time it is always in a straight line.... I am thinking we may have a type A personality on our hands here!!
