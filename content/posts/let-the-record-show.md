There is a whole lot of hype round these parts about the Orioles… with a 4-1 record to start the season, some new acquisitions over the off season and a new manager last season, for the first time in a LONG time, things are looking up for the Baltimore Orioles.&#160; 

And I feel the need to 1. explain the weird circus family sports allegiance when it comes to Baltimore and Pittsburgh and 2.&#160; let the record show that my son is not jumping on the bandwagon. 

1.&#160; How is it that we are nuts about the Steelers and then route for the Orioles?&#160;&#160; My family came from Pittsburgh and we lived in MD for 13 years before my parents moved back to PA.&#160; My dad is a huge sports fan and one way we bonded through the years was by watching sports together.&#160; He raised me a Steelers fan true and true.&#160; My dad is also a Pirates fan but while living in MD he did take me to several O games.&#160; I recall watching Cal Ripken and Rafael Palmeiro at Camden Yards.&#160; I even remember a few games at Memorial Stadium.&#160; I was never a huge baseball fan, though I loved the atmosphere of going to a game.&#160; Dad didn’t mind cheering for the O’s as they were an AL team and the Pirates were NL.&#160;&#160;&#160; The Ravens are different story.&#160; They came to Baltimore when I was just about out of high school.&#160; They came from Pittsburgh’s long standing Rival (the Cleveland Browns) and not only are they in our conference, they are in our division.&#160; Simply put, you can’t route for the Ravens and the Steelers.&#160; 

So, that is why we have no aversion to the Orioles.&#160; 

I really didn’t start for real caring about the Orioles though until my son started liking them a few years back.&#160; Which leads me to point number 2.

![IMG_4426](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_4426.jpg "IMG_4426")2.&#160; My son is a baseball fan and more importantly an Orioles fan, on his own right.&#160; He routed for them in September when [no one else would bother showing up for a home game.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/09/11/take-me-out-to-the-ballgame/)&#160; 

Neither Scott nor I really cared much about baseball.&#160;&#160; When our [![IMG_1494](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_1494.jpg "IMG_1494")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_1494.jpg)son was two, his aunt Karen and Uncle Jim mailed him a tee ball stand for his second birthday.&#160; And he was hooked ever since (wouldn’t you be if you could swing a bat at a ball _in the house_)&#160; _That’s circus life for ya._&#160;&#160; He would ask to watch baseball on TV and then sit and watch (for waaay longer than I found interesting) whatever game I could find on tv.&#160; For awhile there Sports Center was the perfect show b/c he could watch clips of baseball and we could get clips of football, all in the same program.&#160; After that I would start dvr’ing (yes, I am sure that is a word) baseball games for him to watch.&#160; It made sense to Scott and I that since he came about his love of baseball on his own, he could route for the hometown team.&#160; We had no aversion to the Orioles, nor love for the Pirates.&#160;

So, through the years, we have tried to make it to a few games a year… some Baysox (our local minor league team) and some Orioles.&#160;&#160; I have always been impressed with his attention span when it comes to watching the game.&#160; He always wants to stay till the end.&#160;&#160; My favorite memory of taking them to a game was [last summer.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/08/25/americas-pastime/)&#160; It was a beautiful night and the kids were well behaved and enjoying the atmosphere.&#160; It was one of those nights where I truly enjoyed life through the eyes of my children.&#160;&#160;&#160; For my oldest son, however, the night was bitter sweet.&#160; He had heard talk of the new manager that had come to Baltimore and how he was going to turn things around for the Orioles.&#160;&#160; And so, unlike the previous times when we came to Orioles games, this time, my son came expecting to see them win.&#160; And as the game went on it became quite clear to Scott and I, that it wasn’t going to happen that night.&#160; We were ready to go, but my son insisted we stay longer.&#160; Finally in the 9th inning when the other team scored 3 runs and the O’s still had nothing on the board, he realized the inevitable.&#160;&#160; He looked over at me with tears coming down his cheeks and said so forlornly, “Mom, they aren’t going to win, are they?”&#160; I told him I didn’t think it was possible and he said with all the sweet innocence of a 6 year old, _“Mom, I Just wanted to see them win.&#160; I’ve never seen the Orioles win and I just wanted to watch them win.”&#160; [![IMG_2117](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_2117.jpg "IMG_2117")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_2117.jpg)&#160;_ And that is why years ago his Uncle Jim&#160; told him, “Well, kid, no one can ever accuse you of jumping on the band wagon.”&#160; To which my son replied, “What is a band wagon and what does that have to do with baseball?”&#160; 

We had some friends over a few weeks ago and the subject of baseball came up.&#160; The husband was a huge Orioles fan and when we told him our son was, he then started asking him questions about his favorite players and all.&#160; It was in that moment, I realized what a horrible mom I am.&#160; I have done nothing to educate him on the players or the team.&#160; I don’t want to raise one of those fans, ya know the ones who say, “Yea… we love the &lt;insert name of team here&gt;!”&#160; And then when asked to name 2 players on the team they give you a blank stare.&#160;&#160; I find those kind of football fans to be so obnoxious… my son deserves better than that.&#160; So today we sat down after doing our school work and read the sports page together.&#160; I told him we could do this each day.&#160; We can read it together, learn more about the players, and follow how they are doing.&#160; It will educate us both on the team and the sport and provide a sweet mother/son bonding moment at the same time.

&#160; [![IMG_0013](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0013.jpg "IMG_0013")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0013.jpg)

And if the Orioles winning streak continues and they end this season, for the first time in 13 years, with a winning record, I want the record to show that my son was a fan way back when…
