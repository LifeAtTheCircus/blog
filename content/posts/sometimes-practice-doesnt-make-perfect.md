[![swim-team-21](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/swim-team-21-300x300.jpg "swim-team-21")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/swim-team-21.jpg)Looking at this picture one would assume I was preparing to dive into the swimming pool.  Don't be fooled.  Despite being on the swim team for 5 summers and having literally every adult I knew work with me one on one, I never learned to dive.  This is me looking the part before I belly flopped into the swimming pool.

Starting in about 3rd grade and going through the end of middle school, I spent every summer on the swim team.  I actually enjoyed it even though I was not very good.  I could swim all of the strokes and I loved practice because you really only had to get in the pool once, then you just swam lap after lap.  Swimming laps I could handle.  Diving and doing the flip turns was another story.  My flip turns were more like flip half turns.  I really liked the back stroke because I could start in the water.  My first year I was great at back stroke because you only had to do one lap of the pool.  I never really excelled in swimming because despite how fast I could go down the lane, the late start from the _dive-flop_ and the delay from the _half-flippy-turn around_ slowed me down.   Sometimes I got to go to the Divisional Championships.  This wasn't because I was "SO GOOD"  but more because their were few enough swimmers in the category that I "qualified."  I distinctly remember looking up my standing at the Divisional Swim Meet and seeing they ranked me 18 of 18 going into the meet.  All I had to do was show up and I could attain the goal set for me by my coach, if I beat ANYone then I exceeded expectations.  Nice to have no pressure!!  (I never exceeded these expectations)  

I can remember every coach I had pulling me aside to work on diving, life guards during free swim, my mom, my parents friends, LITERALLY every grown up I knew that knew how to swim spent time working with me on diving.  Eventually I learned a sort of dive flop... not a full out belly flop, but still not a complete dive.  

I am thankful I did learn to swim and I do enjoy swimming.  To this day I prefer to just get in and do laps and I stay away from the diving board.  I would be happy to teach my kids to swim, but they'll have to learn to dive from their father.
