My 5 year old decided she wanted to write a book yesterday.&#160; She wanted it to be a collection of stories about animals.&#160; So, she asked if I would write what she said up on our dry erase board so that she could copy them into her book.&#160; 

Here is what she said:

I have to wonder how many different ways a cat licks.&#160; They all look the same to me. 

And I always thought dogs had better hearing than cats.&#160; It appears in her book dogs are only good at eating.
