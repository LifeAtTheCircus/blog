One of my very first blog posts ever was on [my children’s love of kidney beans.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/03/29/roll-that-beautiful-bean-footage/)&#160;&#160; It is now 3 years later and my girls have moved on to baked beans.&#160; Seriously, [the love my daughter has for baked beans](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/09/15/thats-what-she-said/) can NOT be overstated.&#160; 

Last week I figured it was time to try the kidney beans out on number 4.&#160; (let the playgroup&#160; mocking begin).

What do you mean I shouldn’t eat too many at once?&#160;

and the verdict is?

Looks like we have another bean lover here at the circus.&#160; Though truth be told, I have YET to find a food this guy doesn’t like to eat.&#160; He will gladly eat anything I put in front of him.
