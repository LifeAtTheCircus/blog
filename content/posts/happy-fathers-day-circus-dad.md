They saying becoming a parent changes you.&#160;&#160; It does.&#160; Truly, nothing can prepare you for it.&#160; 

I remember so well the day our first born child entered the world.&#160;&#160; I remember all the nerves and excitement. One of the things that surprised me the most about becoming a mom was how much I fell even more in love with Scott on that day.&#160; I already loved him to pieces.&#160; He was already all I could have wanted and more in a husband.&#160; 

And then he held my hand and coached me through child birth.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

And my love for him grew to heights I didn’t know existed.&#160; 

Seriously, I remember sitting in my hospital bed that night, holding my baby boy and thinking, “Scott is the most amazing man I know. I could never have gotten through today without him.”&#160;&#160;

And now, 10 years and 3 more children later, I feel the same way.&#160; I can not imagine going through the journey of parenthood without Scott by my side.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

His is the voice of reason, when I want to veer more towards irrational.&#160; He is wise beyond his years and so intentional in all he does.&#160; I appreciate that so much about him.&#160; 

He’s the dad who sings silly ballads to the kids when they come down with sleepy eyes at breakfast.&#160; He’s the dad that you can hear yelling above all the others when the girls are competing in a gymnasium full of people.&#160;&#160; He’s the dad that comes home for lunch more times than not, just so he can spend some time with the kids in the middle of the day.&#160;&#160; He’s the dad that will use his vacation time to go with us to see the Elephant Parade in Baltimore or the Blue Angels in Annapolis.&#160; He’s the dad that will buy his girl a cat and put up with a liter box in his master bathroom, when he really doesn’t like cats at all.&#160; He’s the dad that lets his kids treat him like a jungle gym.&#160; He fully embraces the chaos that is our life at this stage and all that entails and he cherishes every minute of it.&#160;

I am so grateful to have him by my side as we raise our children.&#160; I hope and pray that our sons grow up to be just like him and that our daughters are as fortunate as I was to find such a man to marry and raise a family with.&#160; My heart is full of gratitude at the immense gift and blessing he is to our family.
