Write it down folks.&#160; Circle it on your calendar.&#160; 

I’ve dreamed of this day for months.&#160; I’ve gotten so close only to be thwarted.

But, folks… it finally happened.

The circus family is caught up on laundry.

I know, I never thought it would happen either.&#160;&#160; Friday afternoon I washed my Christmas table cloth.&#160; This evening, I dry cleaned our sweaters with one of those handy [Woolite Dry Cleaning](http://www.amazon.com/Dry-Cleaners-Secret-Cleaning-14-Count/dp/B0006G3PM8) sheets.&#160;&#160; 

In fact, except for that dry clean load, I was caught up on Friday afternoon and this evening I just washed the clothes we wore this weekend.&#160;&#160;&#160; That’s right… the only clothes that are dirty at the circus abode right now are the pjs we are currently wearing.&#160; 

In fact, we uncovered a problem that I’ve never encountered here before.&#160; Since all of our clothes are clean, I actually ran out of hangers.&#160; I have clean clothes folded and ready to go in the closet, after I go buy more hangers tomorrow.&#160; I also have bulging dresser drawers… which tells me that this week I need to go through our clothes and bag up the winter clothes.

What will I do with this new found state of being?

Well, I have a plan.&#160; I’ve been conjuring it up for months and I think it is fool proof.&#160; I have a laundry basket sitting in the hallway outside of our bedroom doors and each evening we will throw our dirty clothes into it.&#160; And each morning I will wash that load.&#160;&#160; With 5, soon to be 6, people dirtying clothes, we actually make a load of clothes a day with my small washing machine. 

Meaning, the circus will stay on top of the laundry.

Stop laughing, I really think this is possible.&#160; 

No, I mean it, it is not nice to laugh at an 8 month pregnant momma.&#160; 

I figure every night before I go to bed, I run the dishwasher, then I unload and put away the dishes the next morning.&#160; Why can’t I run the laundry every morning and fold the clothes during nap time?&#160; It is totally doable… it just hasn’t been for months because it has taken me literally months to get caught up on the back log.&#160; But, now that I am… I am confident we can boldly go where this circus mom has never gone before.&#160; 

Hey, I might even have time to stay on top of the sheets and towels on a weekly basis.&#160;&#160; Can you believe it??
