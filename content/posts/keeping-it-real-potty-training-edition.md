In the interest of keeping it real and not pretending to be something I am not, I feel the need to come clean.

Remember how excited I was when my 2 year old was wearing underwear at her 2nd birthday? 

Yea, I believe I received many a pat on the back and comments of “You’ll have to come potty train my kid.”

Well, I must come clean and say for the past few weeks she has totally regressed.&#160; Yes, she goes on the potty several times a day, but she also goes in her pants several times a day.&#160; This is quite frustrating as for several weeks she was doing wonderfully, even being dry at night on more than one occasion.&#160; 

But after peeing not once, but TWICE in Safeway a few weeks ago, and after my having to ask for paper towels 3 times during that shopping trip to wipe pee of the cart, the floor, and our groceries, I decided she’s in pull ups until she proves she is capable of big girl pants.&#160; Because I am quite tired of mopping up pee, especially in public places.
