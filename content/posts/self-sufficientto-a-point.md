One of the many reasons why life is easier this time around is that my older three kids are much&#160; more self sufficient. 

When we need to head out the door, I can instruct the kids to get their shoes on, go to the van and buckle up.&#160; A few minutes later the baby and I&#160; arrive at the van.&#160; I buckle him in, do a quick seatbelt check on the big kids and we hit the road. 

This works wonderfully… 

except for when it doesn’t…

Like the time I pulled into the parking lot at church, open the side door and find my 5 yr old barefoot.&#160; When questioned about her missing shoes, she responded, “ I couldn’t find them!”&#160;&#160; As I sent her to SS barefoot her sweet teacher (and mother of 6) assured me it wasn’t the first time _(which actually made me wonder, if she meant it wasn’t the first time someone came to SS with no shoes or if it wasn’t the first time MY DAUGHTER came to SS without shoes…I didn’t ask).&#160;_ 

Then there’s my three year old, who when faced with a similar dilemma, went a different route.

And of course mom doesn’t realize she’s not wearing matching shoes until she gets out of the van at the grocery store. 


(yes…her dress in on backwards…another by product of our self sufficiency)


Apparently, I have a few questions I need to add to my check list before backing out of the driveway.&#160; 1.&#160; Is everyone here?&#160; 2.&#160; Seatbelts buckled? 3.&#160; Shoes on?&#160; 4.&#160; Shoes match?
