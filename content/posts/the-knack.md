The other morning I came around the corner to find my 4 year old son unscrewing the screw from the switch plate of our light.  He had gotten his chair, pulled it up to the light switch, found the right size Phillips screw driver, and had gotten the screw mostly off.  I noticed he had been quiet for awhile when I peeked around the corner to check on him and saw this.

He wanted to see what electricity looked like.

Of course I told him to NEVER, NEVER, EVER, take off light switch plates or outlet plates, EVER, EVER.  This event horrified me.  This was no kidding dangerous.  I praise God he did not get farther then he did.  Just last week I said he was [smart enough to get himself in trouble](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/05/no-electricity-water-or-internet/) someday and this was almost that day.  He asked a lot of questions during the power outage and apparently learned a lot.



I couldn't help but think of the Dilbert comic my husband, the engineer, had forwarded home from work before.  Looks, like he too might have the knack....

(P.S. I yelled at him immediately, the above picture is him screwing the screw back in...forever)
