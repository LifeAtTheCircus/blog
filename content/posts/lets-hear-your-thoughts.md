My oldest son is five.&#160;&#160;&#160; He’s gotten to the point where he wants things.&#160; And his birthday and&#160; Christmas are over.&#160; He’s [already proven](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/30/the-value-of-a-penny-saved/) that he has the self control and discipline to save up for things.&#160; 

But he has no income.

I would like to start developing in him the discipline to save and to choose wisely how to spend his money.&#160; 

So, I was wondering, do any of you give your children allowances? 

If so, at what age did you start? 

Did you have your child do chores to earn the allowance? 

How much did you give? 

And what do you do about the younger siblings?&#160; Do they all start getting an allowance now? 

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this, so please share!!
