Since late last fall, our youngest daughter has been lobbying hard for a cat.&#160; She did a school project on one, she drew endless pictures of them, [she wrote stories about them,](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2013/04/23/animal-stories/) she slept with her stuffed animal cat every night and my favorite was the note she wrote Scott listing all their fine attributes.

We waited it out awhile, trying to see if it was merely a passing phase or if it would stick.&#160; We figured if come July when her birthday rolls around, she’s still stuck on cats, then we’d most likely allow her to have one.&#160; (we never told her that of course)

July came.&#160; She turned six and she was still crazy for cats.

If it would dig his or her claws into him, he’d giggle and say, “It scratched me, but that’s ok.&#160; It likes me.”&#160;&#160; Meanwhile my daughter was happy to hold just one.&#160; 

Tonight we welcomed Cartwheel into the Circus Family.

We are hoping that by getting both a puppy and a kitten close together neither would feel like the dominate animal and maybe they’d get along.&#160;

It’s a bit soon to say how that is working out… she’d been home a whole 2 hours.&#160; There was some hissing, some barking and some hair standing on end.&#160; Scott’s not very optimistic but I am hopeful they will work things out and become friends.&#160; Or at least they’ll get along.&#160;

On July 14th we welcomed our pup Wendy to the circus fam and 11 days later we welcomed our kitten Cartwheel to the crew as well.&#160; _Go ahead and say it, we admit it, we are a bit crazy!_
