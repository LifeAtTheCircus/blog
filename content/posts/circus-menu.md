Between baseball practice, swim lessons, sailing races, and deacon meetings, our evenings can get quite busy.&#160; And one thing my family is passionate about is their food.&#160; Not so keen on skipping diner. So, to keep dinner on the table, I have found it is helpful to have a plan.&#160; 

I must confess I used to be much better about the plan. I’d write up my meal plan for the month and then make my grocery list based on it.&#160; But, for the past few months I’ve let it go and kinda figured out dinner at the beginning of the day.&#160; 

This week I’m trying out a meal plan again..taking a step back from the monthly plan and trying out the week, it’s gotta be better than the daily opening of the cupboard and figuring out what we have that the kids will eat.&#160; We’ll see how it goes.&#160; 

**Monday**:&#160; sloppy joes, mac-n-cheese, sweet corn

**Tuesday**: enchiladas and corn bread, salad

**Wednesday**: Breakfast for dinner-scrambled eggs, bacon, blueberry muffins

**Thursday**: Fiesta Chicken, rice, peas or green beans

**Friday**:&#160; spaghetti and meatballs, salad, rolls

**Saturday**:&#160; whole wheat pizza, salad

**Fiesta Chicken Recipe:**

**Place frozen chicken breasts in crock pot.&#160; Pour small jar of salsa over top. Cook in crock pot on low for 8 hrs.&#160; Pour chicken and salsa over warm rice and top with shredded cheddar cheese.&#160;**
