I am just gonna come out and say it… ya know those cutesie little stick people families you see on the back of minivans these days?

I want one.

But, I struggle with this for many reasons. 

1. I am a tad embarrassed.&#160; Like maybe those little stick people families are too cutesie and my friends will laugh and roll their eyes when they see me pull into the parking lot. 

2.&#160; I don’t think I deserve one.&#160; Those cute lil stick people families seem like they belong on the back of a minivan that is clean and organized.&#160; It seems like moms of stick families drive vans free of trash and toys littering the floor.&#160; They’re the moms who arrive to practice on time, with water bottles and a nice big blanket for the family to sit on and watch practice.&#160; Doesn’t seem like they belong to the moms who show up with children wearing mixed matches shoes, who forgot their water bottles and who bring their light sabers to battle while they wait for their sibling to practice.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

3.&#160; Lastly, let’s just say I got over my stick people issues, how in the world do I choose?&#160;&#160; 

I’ve spent a fair amount of time this week browsing the good ol’ world wide web looking for [stick people](http://www.familystickers.com/?gclid=CK-kg8PT9KgCFUSo4AodelplSw) to represent the circus fam.&#160; And let me tell you, it ain’t easy.&#160;&#160; How in the world do you find one person to adequately caricaturize your family member?&#160; Honestly, mine and baby number 4 are the easiest… there are a plethora of “mom juggling” stick people to pretty much ![Family Stickers, Family Car Stickers, Family Decals, Family Car Decals](http://www.wmishops.com/magento/skin/frontend/wmishops/familystickers/images/logos/familystickers/logo.gif)sum up myself.&#160; And thankfully with the one year old, I pretty much have to choose between baby holding bottle, baby with pacifier and baby crawling or walking.&#160; But how do I pick Scott’s?&#160; Do I go with working man?&#160; Doesn’t that seem like maybe he is a work-a-holic?&#160; He likes to barbeque, but does that really sum up his whole persona?&#160; Not really…And while he does enjoy drinking a beer every now and again, I highly doubt that is the symbol he wants gracing the back of the van. ![family window sticker](http://www.fullintensitygrafx.com/images/cust_lg/cust119.jpg) If only they had a guy on a sailboat… I have [searched](http://www.myjollyfamily.com) and [searched](http://www.fullintensitygrafx.com/family_decals.php) for this to no avail.&#160; If he did karate, I could find that, but sailing, no such luck.&#160;&#160;&#160; And what about the kids?&#160; My son likes baseball, is a cub scout, enjoys playing army and legos and Star Wars… how does one pick one activity, one symbol to describe him?&#160;&#160; And the girls??&#160; They both love soccer and gymnastics… can I find a gymnast kicking a soccer ball?&#160; No…. 

What are your thoughts on the stick people gracing the backs of minivans in front of you on the road?&#160; Do you have one?&#160; How did you pick?&#160; What do you think I should pick for us?&#160; Or do you think I should leave well enough alone and not bother with the stick people on the back of the circus mobile?
