Ever since I saw the movie [Space Camp](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091993/), it’s been a desire of mine to see a space shuttle launch, up close and in person.&#160; I’m not a space nut or anything, but I do find the whole concept of space travel fascinating.&#160; And while I don’t have a technical bucket list, so to say, if I did, seeing a launch in person would most definitely be on that list.&#160;&#160; Which, is why we switched our vacation plans around last fall and [took our family to Florida](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/11/01/on-becoming-a-germophobe/), to try and see the last launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery and one of the last U.S. space shuttle launches ever. 

But, as I wrote about [back in November](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/11/08/321/), the Discovery experienced some technical difficulties which postponed the launch until February 24, 2011.&#160; Can you imagine if we had waited it out?&#160; Can you say “Longest Camping Trip Ever!”&#160; or “Mama is going bananas!”??

I am a friend of the [KSC on face book](http://www.facebook.com/KennedySpaceCenterVisitorComplex) and I have been following the updates since last summer.&#160; (OK, so maybe I am a little of a space nut…or just a nut) and as the rescheduled date drew nearer there was a very big part of me that wanted to hop in the van, drive to Florida and watch it.&#160;

As the minutes ticked by (we started watching an hour prior to blast off),my thoughts turned to the only other launch I recall watching on TV.&#160; I was in first grade and our class had gone to the media center to watch the launch on a little tv.&#160; It was a big deal b/c a teacher was on the space shuttle that time.&#160; Many of you may remember that tragic January day in 1986 when the [Challenger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster) crashed.&#160;&#160; As if he was reading my mind, my son asked, “Mom, if the space shuttle crashes, you’ll stop recording it right?”&#160; A few minutes later he commented on how brave these astronauts were to risk flying into space.&#160; He then led us in prayer for the safety of the astronauts about to blast off into space.&#160;&#160;&#160; It was a sobering and touching moment.

[![IMG_9027](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMG_9027.jpg "IMG_9027")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMG_9027.jpg)As we got to T-10 minutes, we all got a bit excited.&#160; We were eating popcorn and my youngest had dawned an astronaut costume.&#160; The oldest 2 didn’t have costumes so they improvised with boots, coats, and winter hats…Hey, whatever works, right? 

 And then, it was time… 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1…BLAST OFF!!!

It was a successful launch, and right now the Discovery is in space on its way to the International Space Station.&#160;&#160;&#160; There are 2 more launches scheduled for the space program… one in April and one in June.&#160; I would be lying if I didn’t confess that part of me is still scheming to see if there is a way for us to go and watch one.&#160;&#160; If not, you better believe we’ll be watching NASA TV those days…perhaps giving further evidence to the fact that I may indeed be a space nut.
