One of my favorite parts about home schooling has been the field trips.&#160; We have tutorial sessions on Mon and Wed.&#160; Tues we have school at home and typically it is a catch up day for me around the house.&#160; I try to keep Tuesdays open as I need that day to just be at home.&#160; Thursdays we have school at home, plus [BSF](http://www.bsfinternational.org/) in the morning, and often a play date over lunch. Thursdays are busy and full.&#160; Fridays, however, are often field trip days.&#160; We get our school work done in the morning and then often, not always, we take field trips.&#160; The past two Fridays have been Field Trip Fridays.&#160; First, we went to a farm to learn about the life of the Pilgrims and Indians.&#160; They had people dressed in period costumes as we learned about the Indians, Pilgrim chores, Pilgrim home life, and Pilgrim play.&#160; This was topped off with the most extreme and fun hay ride I’ve ever been on and the chance to pick popping corn from the corn field.&#160; 

The following Friday I organized a field trip for the tutorial class to the local police station.&#160; The officers did a fabulous job of showing us around the facility and educating us on their job.&#160; I found it incredibly interesting and kept thinking about how much it reminded me of [the District](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_District).&#160; Truth be told, I think I liked it even more than the kids… must be that part of me that loves those cop/crime drama shows.&#160; 

Here’s some pictures of our Friday Field Trip Fun!

Yes, the hay ride went right through the creek… I told you it was extreme hay riding&#160;&#160; [![IMG_3181](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3181.jpg "IMG_3181")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3181.jpg)

Hopefully the only time my girls experience life inside of a holding cell….and yes, I sanitized them heavily and immediately.

The hand cuffs and the taser demo were definite hits with the kids&#160; [![IMG_3415](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3415.jpg "IMG_3415")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3415.jpg)
