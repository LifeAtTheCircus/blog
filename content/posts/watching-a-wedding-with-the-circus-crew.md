A few weeks ago Scott’s cousin was married in CA.&#160; Since the groom was from Brazil, we were among many friends and relatives that weren’t able to attend the ceremony.&#160; The family thoughtfully broadcasted the ceremony live on the internet.&#160; I had never attending a wedding this way before.&#160; 

While we would have preferred to attend the wedding in person and share in their celebration with them, in some ways, it was the easiest way to watch the ceremony with our three kids present.

The kids were able to play during the ceremony without us having to worry about them disturbing anyone else.&#160;&#160; My daughter made sure that all of the [little people](http://www.fisher-price.com/fp.aspx?st=10&amp;e=littlepeople) were present and lined up to see the ceremony,&#160; while my son flew something around the room.

We were able to type messages to the bride and groom and they could talk back to us.&#160; My daughter didn’t&#160; quite grasp the fact that they couldn’t see her though.&#160; Here she is holding up some signs for them.&#160; [![IMG_2466](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-2466-thumb.jpg "IMG_2466")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-2466.jpg)

Eventually they got so out of control that even though they weren’t disturbing any of the other guests, they were disturbing us (first time I was ever body bashed while watching a wedding) so we sent them to their room to play.&#160; [![IMG_2481](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-2481-thumb.jpg "IMG_2481")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-2481.jpg)

Every now and then they’d come out though.&#160; At one point my son was marching through the room singing, “Pha-roah, Pha-roh, let my people go,&#160; before God smites you with his hand” not your typical wedding song.&#160; After the ceremony was over and we got to “talk” to the beautiful bride and groom as well as extended family members, we went back to the kids room.&#160;

It appears that they thought a fun way to play quietly was to take every.single. paper out of their binders and scatter them over their entire bedroom.&#160; Nice, huh?

We were so thankful that we had the opportunity to share in bride and groom’s special day from the other side of the country.&#160; I’m pretty certain though that they won’t be including these pictures in their wedding album.&#160; For more pictures that won’t see the inside of a scrapbook, check out [We are THAT Family.](http://www.wearethatfamily.com)
