Welcome to Not Me! Monday! This blog carnival was created by [MckMama](http://www.mycharmingkids.net). You can head over to [her blog](http://www.mycharmingkids.net) to read what she and everyone else have not been doing this week. 

While I was posting about my true [love story](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/02/13/the-college-years/) each day last week, a whole circus load of activity was going on around here.

I _did not_…

*   put my kids to bed without having them brush their teeth because we got home late from a church meeting and I was trying to rush the bedtime routine.
*   I certainly _didn’t_ forget to bring their fluoride in like I had promised resulting in my son waking up the next morning and saying, “Mom, you never brought us our fluoride, do you want us to get cavities?”
*   take a picture of my son’s nose after he ran smack into the baby gate/wall on his way to bed

(please note I only took the picture so I could compare it later to see if it looked better or worse in the morning)&#160; (it looked worse…got a nice shade of black and blue a few days later too)

Back to my not me list.&#160; I also didn’t…

*   show up at my pediatrician’s office on Wednesday with all three kids dressed and looking nice (I was feeling so proud of myself) at 8:57 for our 9:00 appointment only to learn that our appointment was actually Friday at 9:30.&#160;
*   Take my son to the grocery store on Friday morning in his pajamas to buy his valentine cards for his party that morning.&#160;
*   And I certainly didn’t give his teacher a gift which I used reinforcement circles to attach the card to because I couldn’t find tape in my rush to get everyone out the door in time for school.&#160; Classy, huh?

Yea… I know it looked like me, but it must have been someone else doing those things, because I was busy reminiscing about how Scott and I [met](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/02/10/how-the-circus-began/) and [fell in love.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/02/14/a-forever-kind-of-love/)&#160;

_What?&#160; Give them chocolate fondue for dessert?&#160; Let them dip the fruit themselves??&#160; No way, NOT ME!!_
