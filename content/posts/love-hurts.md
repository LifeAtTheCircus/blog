I love this picture.&#160; I love it because it shows the kids and my husband engaged in play after a long day of work.&#160;&#160;

I also love how the big kids seem to be attacking him b/c he’s got the youngest on his shoulders.&#160; Almost as if they are trying to get in on the action and attention.&#160; 

But take a closer look, because if you check out Scott’s face, you’ll find another gem.

Ah, love hurts, doesn’t it?&#160; 

But just for kicks, check out this shot.&#160;

I love the look on both of their faces.&#160; Priceless, huh?
