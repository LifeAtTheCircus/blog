Last week the girls and I were at the auto mechanic waiting to get the oil changed in our minivan.&#160; We were sitting nicely in the the waiting room reading books and enjoying some goldfish when suddenly I look over at the older one and shockingly find her standing in the waiting room (filled with people) with her pants and underwear down to her ankles.&#160; I quickly pull them up and ask her why she did this and she explains that her “butt hurts.”&#160; I quickly take her into the bathroom to fix this.

Today I took the kids to the park to enjoy our heat wave (45 degrees today).&#160; As I was unloading the girls I look over to see my son with his drawers dropped, peeing in the grass.&#160; 

“What are you doing?” I shriek as I then make eye contact with the mom in the car beside ours.&#160; “I have to pee,” he explains.&#160; 

As if it is ok to just pee wherever we want.&#160; 

For the second time in a week, I find myself hurriedly pulling up my child’s pants and ushering him away from the public spectacle we’ve caused.&#160; Thankfully, we have our [in van potty seat](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/11/11/best-potty-training-trick-ever/), which I find in the back of the van.&#160;&#160; Apparently he really had to go b/c he tried to go in the parking lot when I set it on the ground.&#160; I quickly get it in the van and out of the world’s view.&#160; He asks why he can’t pee in the grass.&#160; I say b/c it is gross and people walk there.&#160; He then asks if he could pee in poison ivy (I know his logic is that no one would be walking on poison ivy).&#160; I caution him that it isn’t a good idea to pee in poison ivy either.

Apparently I need to have a little talk with my children about decency and what behaviors are and aren’t appropriate in public.&#160;
