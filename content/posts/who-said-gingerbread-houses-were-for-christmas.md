Much like the [decorating of the pumpkin](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/11/07/better-late-than-never-right/), the constructing of the gingerbread house didn’t happen according to the traditional time line.&#160; We here at the circus like to do things in our own time, thank you very much! 

I mentioned before that this year I decided to go with the kit over [baking from scratch.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/10/gingerbread-real-estate/)&#160; I bought the kit in early December and kept waiting for that evening when we were all home and not already busy with something else.&#160; I didn’t want to cram it in just to do it, I wanted to enjoy it.&#160; 

And so, the gingerbread house was built on January 5th.&#160; Same day I got around to taking the ornaments of off our tree and our decor off the walls.&#160; My son asked if we could keep the gingerbread house out or if we had to take it down too.&#160; I assured him we could keep it up for a few weeks.&#160;

I told Scott next year I might just plan to build the gingerbread house after Christmas and go ahead and wait to buy the kit till afterwards as well.&#160; We could save 75% on the cost and we all had just as much fun doing it in Jan as we’d have had in December (maybe even more).&#160;
