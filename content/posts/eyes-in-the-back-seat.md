It’s that time again… the mailers, the prerecorded phone calls, and those signs covering any square inch of grass on the side of the road.

That’s right…election time in Maryland.&#160; 

Maybe it’s just me, but it seems people have hit the signs hard and a bit early this year.&#160; 

Typically I pay little to no attention to them.&#160; Sure I notice them in passing, but I barely read them and I don’t plan to make my vote in November based on the yellow sign I saw on the side of the road. 

My son however is a different story.

**Every-Single-Time** we’re out driving he’s calling my attention to them.

“What’s that one say,Mom?”&#160; He’s running for Senate.&#160; (insert long discussion on senators here and the difference between state and federal government)

“What about that red one Mom, what’s he for”&#160; “Fiscal responsibility”&#160; (inset medium length discussion on what fiscal is and what it means to be responsible with our money)

He doesn’t stop with just one sign.&#160; At a single traffic light, I am reading and explaining all 15 signs polluting the corner. 

“Which one is going to take care of bad guys?” he wanted to know.&#160;&#160; Apparently my son cares more about national defense than fiscal responsibility.&#160; 

He then wanted to know which one I was going to vote for and who I will vote for president in 2 yrs.&#160; I was able to explain that I make my decision to vote based on what the candidate stands for, what issues they care about, not the catchy slogan on their sign, or even their political party.&#160; So, since I don’t know who will be running for President in 2 yrs, I don’t know&#160; yet who I will vote for.&#160; And I need to do more homework before this election to figure out my vote for November.&#160; 

Thankfully, I’ve got a little accountability in the back seat to make sure I stay up on my politics.&#160; Perhaps those signs are worthwhile after all.
