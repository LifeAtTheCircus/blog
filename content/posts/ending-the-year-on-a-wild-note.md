&#160;

Make a mental note… for a really good visit to the zoo, try going on a mild day in the off season, shortly before closing time… hardly any people were there and the animals were quite active.&#160;&#160; 

Scott snapped some great shots of the animals up close and personal.

The lion came right up to the window and then almost seemed to look right past us as if we weren’t there.&#160; It was incredible!

Hungry?

We also took advantage of the petting zoo.&#160; Those goats were adorable!&#160; I had so much fun watching my youngest pal around with them.&#160; [![IMG_0432](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_0432.jpg "IMG_0432")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_0432.jpg)

Then he decided it was time for them to go back to their pen and he began herding them… pushing them into their pen one at a time… We were so lucky they didn’t decide to unload on him!!
