We may not always agree with Obama's view on the roll of government but, regardless of where we stand politically, this truly is a huge and monumental milestone for our country.  My husband was reading on BBC.com this morning and sent me an e-mail with some quotes and thoughts that I hadn't fully considered.   I thought they were worth sharing.  
> " On 28 August 1963, Martin Luther King spoke of his dream for America, with the brooding statue of Abraham Lincoln offering the most glorious of pulpits.  
> 
> On 20 January 2009, Barack Obama will appear on the west steps of the US Capitol, at the other end of the Washington Mall, and seal his historic triumph with just 35 words: the presidential oath of office. "  
Look how much has changed in less then 50 years.  

Another cool mental image….  
> " A quirk of scheduling and a quantum leap of history meant that Mr. Obama delivered his acceptance speech in Denver on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech. "  
This really is a moment to be proud of.  It's so great that God's common grace can extend onto a people such as ours in such abundance.  People often ask, "If there is a God then why is there evil in the world".  To this, Christians often respond, "If there is no God then from where comes the moral compass that brings such good in the world".  

To think that America has seen the light so clearly after over 150 years of injustice and persecution of African Americans is a beautiful thing to behold.  If ever there was a time where all seemed lost it would have been just 60 years ago when everything was segregated and de-segregation would mean a loss of power for the advantaged.  We've all heard the term, "Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely".  Somehow, through the sacrifice of many many people, that power did not corrupt absolutely.  It didn't happen overnight, and it is not yet finished, but it is happening and last night we got to witness and be part of something great.  Evidence of God's common grace.
