As my 4 yr old sat coloring in the waiting room this afternoon the mom beside me commented on her neat job of staying in the lines.&#160; 

Then we both did a double take and looked over at each other.&#160;

Don’t
](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/belle.jpg) mind the fact that the dress is green and should “really” be yellow… I love the fact that my girl goes against the flow and colors it how she wants… sure give Belle purple hair and a green dress.&#160; Why not? 

But, what is up with that neck line?&#160; Seems a bit low cut don’t ya think?&#160; I am hoping that somehow the coloring book missed a line or something.&#160; But it sure looks to me like she was coloring it in correctly…

Never expected that from Belle… Ariel maybe, but Belle… with her nose stuck in a book… ya gotta watch those good girls I suppose!
