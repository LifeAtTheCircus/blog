Gentleman.&#160; 

I am convinced that if you were to look the word up in the dictionary, you’d have to find a picture of this man.&#160; 

[![Grandpa](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Grandpa.jpg "Grandpa")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Grandpa.jpg) I first met him at our high school graduation.&#160; I remember being taken with the fact that he had one of those sweaters with the reinforced elbows and&#160; remarked to Scott how much I loved his genuine “Grandpa sweater” and was convinced he’d be the perfect Worthers Original grandpa. 

Somewhere over the past 12 years he went from being Scott’s grandpa, to&#160; my grandpa too.&#160; I can’t pinpoint the moment it occurred, but I can tell you that I truly love him like my own.&#160;&#160; 

Grandpa is the kind of man that walks you to your car after a visit, and insists on carrying your things for you.&#160; When you instinctually start to object and insist, “I’m fine” your words stop in your throat b/c you know its no use and you simply say “thank you.”&#160; He’s funny and witty and I am pretty sure we have him to thank for the sarcastic streak that runs through Scott’s side of the family.&#160;&#160;

We’re blessed to live close to grandpa and because of this I can say, “he’s&#160; always there.”&#160; Every holiday, birthday party, every gathering big or small, you can count on him being there.&#160; I quite honestly can’t imagine it any other way (nor would I want to).&#160; He’s also there when you’re in a pinch and need some help…like when we couldn’t find a dog sitter for Maggie over Labor Day weekend, or Scott needed a ride to the mechanic to pick him the van, or we couldn’t get a hold of anyone to watch the kids when I went into labor with our third and Grandpa and Grandma dropped everything and came to sit with the kids while we went to the hospital.&#160; Like I said, “he’s always there” and because of this fact I am embarrassed to admit we take his presence for granted.&#160; We don’t spend nearly the amount of time with him that we’d like .&#160; When we do see him we always realize that too&#160; much time has slipped since last time and “gosh I wish we did this more often.”&#160;&#160; That is definitely something Scott and I would like to change.&#160;&#160; We truly are blessed to have him close by and we’d like to take advantage of that gift.&#160; 

Happy Birthday Grandpa!&#160; We all love you!

I know this post doesn’t really fit with the theme of my other&#160; 
weekend 
thoughts, but, it’s the weekend and tonight the extended fam will be getting together to celebrate this wonderful man’s birthday, therefore that’s what I am 
thinking 
about tonight.&#160;&#160;&#160;
