This weekend we went camping with 2 other families.  (More to come on the adventure later)! As we sat under the stars Friday night, I was in awe of our awesome creator God.  Sitting around the fire, I could see the big dipper and I saw 2 shooting stars.  The stars were so bright.  Thank you Father for the beautiful picture of your handiwork.  

Psalm 8:3-4

When I consider your heavens,  
the work of your fingers,  
the moon and the stars,  
which you have set in place,

what is man that you are mindful of  him,  
the son of man that you care for him?

_**Week End Thoughts:**_  
_My posts typically relate  funny anecdotes about the happenings of a stay at home wife and mom with three  kids. While my days are seldom “normal” enough to leave me without a “post  worthy” moment [(i.e. read here)](../2008/04/29/whats-up-doc/#tt), I intend to take some time on the weekend to  highlight something from my week that’s a little more “thoughtful” and  significant. **If you had a post from this week that was reflective in  nature, please add a link in the comments section. I’d love to hear your  thoughts.**_
