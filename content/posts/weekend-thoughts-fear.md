I’m sure you think that I am kidding or exaggerating, but I promise you I am not.&#160;&#160; [Remember this](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/08/up-up-and-away/)?&#160; Well two months after that traumatic experience, Scott took the kids to buy a balloon for my birthday, and needless to say my son (being the oldest child, and the overly cautious one that he is), was very nervous about the balloon flying away.&#160; Scott assured him multiple times, that the balloon was not going anywhere.&#160; He promised that he would not let go of the string and he himself would bring it into the house.&#160; As they step out of the van, my son started freaking out about the balloon.&#160; Scott couldn’t figure out what was wrong since he was still holding onto the string.&#160;&#160; While that was true, the part of the string holding onto the balloon came undone and the balloon floated off into space.&#160; 

Ever since he’s wanted nothing to do with helium.&#160;&#160; You should have seen me this spring as I bought a balloon for Scott’s birthday.&#160; I had to check and recheck the string multiple times.&#160; Still, he begged me not to get one.&#160; And after his youngest sister lost her balloon at Trader Joe’s last month, he’s convinced the girls that they don’t want balloons when they go to the store.&#160;&#160; Last week as we approached TJ’s he said to the girls, “Remember, we don’t want balloons when we go to the store, b/c we don’t want to loose them.”

He is so afraid of losing the balloon, he doesn’t even want it in the first place.

Balloons are fun.&#160; They’re treats.&#160; They are meant to brighten your day, add pizzazz to a party and a light hearted moment to a tiring shopping trip.&#160; 

But for my son they bring more stress than joy.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

And I wonder, how often we let fear keep us from enjoying life’s gifts.&#160;&#160; Are we so afraid of losing what we have that we fail to enjoy it while we have it?&#160; 

I don’t want my life or my children’s lives to be like that.&#160; I don’t want to miss out on the smiles and fun God has planned for us b/c of fear or stress of what we’ll loose.&#160;&#160; I want us to fully enjoy the moments we’re in.
