We brought one along on our trip to the pond [this weekend](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/27/the-lucky-ones/), but didn't feel like going through the effort of taking off her bathing suit and changing her diaper.  

"How much water will the diaper collect, anyway?"  We naively thought.

Apparently, these Luvs diapers can hold quite a bit.  Her poor butt quadrupled in size as it soaked up half the pond that afternoon.  

Kinda takes on new meaning to the phrase, "Does this bathing suit make my butt look big?"
