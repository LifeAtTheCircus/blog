 Remember the time when everything  you encountered was new and exciting, something worthy of careful  inspection?  Bring back the kid in you and pause long enough to discover  something new today.

I am entering this photo in the Nestle "The Kid in You" Photo Contest over at [5 Minutes for Mom](http://www.5minutesformom.com/3464/kid-in-you-photo-contest/) for the chance to win a Nintendo Wii. (I 
played a Wii for the first time this weekend at the house  of [Muthering Heights](http://mutheringheights.blogspot.com/) and let's just say the prize is appropriate because playing tennis really brought out  the kid in all of us)
!
