&quot;_It's Friday night/And the mood is right/Gonna have some fun/Show you how it's done, TGIF.._&quot;

Remember those days?&#160; Nothing better topped off a _hard_ week of going to school and talking on the phone like a little [Full House](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092359/), [Family Matters](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096579/), and [Perfect Strangers.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090501/)&#160; 

T.G.I.F.

If ever there was a week that needed an end, this week here at the circus, was it.

What with puke, and then puke, then a missed gymnastics performance due to puke, and then missing your best friends birthday party thanks to your sisters puke, followed by more puke, then a power outage, puke, snow, still more puke, then Daddy away on a business trip, his homecoming strangely enough followed the next morning by still more pukeâ€¦

This weekend promises 60 degree weather.&#160; We are so opening our windows and airing out the place.&#160; We could totally use a new scent around here.

T.G.I.F.
