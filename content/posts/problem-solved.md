Thanks for all who wrote [last week](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/06/23/how-long/) with your thoughts and suggestions on my dinner time dilemma.

No worries though.

Tonight my kids sat down and ate their dinner without one complaint. 

Not one.&#160; 

And let me tell you there was no dilly dallying.&#160; 

They sat on the curb, gobbled it up with relatively little mess and we were on our merry way, walking around downtown enjoying the boats and the harbor.

See, I had it all wrong before.&#160; Slaving over the hot stove, struggling to find new recipes, serving up balanced meals of protein, vegetables, and carbohydrates.&#160; 

Tonight after a fun father’s day celebrating on the high seas we stopped for some **
ice cream
**.&#160;

And as we drove home with our bellies full of milk and sugar, my husband pointed out to me that we hadn’t bothered to feed them any d—i-n-n-e-r tonight.

oops…how did it get to be so late?

By the time we caught fireflies and went inside it was past eight o’ clock.&#160; No one was hungry, so we chocked it up to special occasion and summertime and put them to bed.&#160; Nothing like a bowl full of sugar before bed to ensure a good night of sleep for all.&#160; 

Yes, please just send the mom of the year award to Crystal…aka Circus Mom… I’ll start working on my acceptance speech now… starting off with my tips for healthy, well balanced diets for preschoolers.&#160;
