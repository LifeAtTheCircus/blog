In Science we’ve been talking about what God created on each of the 6 days of creation.&#160; Currently we’re on day 6 and discussing the creatures that walked on the land.&#160; 

While the kids were playing on Friday, they got the idea to group their stuffed animals according to classification.&#160; Of course they didn’t use these exact words.&#160; But, they made a pile of non mammals and another of mammals and then called me in to take a look.&#160; I praised their scientific efforts.&#160; They then decided to find ALL of their stuffed animals to group.&#160; 

I was excited that they were so easily self entertained and let them go at it, while I worked to clean other areas of the house.&#160;&#160; (trying really hard not to think about the 
mess
 huge pile of toys that was being formed in the schoolroom).&#160; 

Every few minutes one of them would come out to ask me, “Is this a mammal?”&#160; “What about horses?”&#160; I reviewed with my son the criteria for mammals.&#160; A short while later he appeared and said, _**“Mom, what about boys?&#160; Are boys mammals?&#160; We have hair, but we don’t make milk.”**_

They were so excited to show me their giant mammal pile, themselves included as they too are mammals.
