It was a perfect day alone with the man of my dreams exploring and enjoying God’s creation.&#160; 

We spent 5 hours exploring the caves 800 feet below the earth’s surface. 

Pictures truly can’t do it justice, but I’ll try.

Can you guess what this rock formation was called? Look closely.

After spending the afternoon in the caverns below, we came up for dinner and then sunset with the bats. 

Yes, you read that correctly.&#160; At dusk 400,000 (no that isn’t a typo, I meant to put all of those zeros there) bats fly out of the caves each night to feast on insects.&#160;&#160; It was amazing (and no I am not some crazy bat loving girl of the night).&#160; As we waited for the bats to fly out of the cave, I was totally grossed and freaked out, yet I knew it was something I didn’t want to miss.&#160; We sat and watched in hushed silence for over an hour as the bats continually flew out of the cave like a river flowing off into the desert.

Afterwards, we enjoyed a starry ride home in the barren desert.

It was one of the best days I’ve spent with my husband in a long, long time.&#160;
