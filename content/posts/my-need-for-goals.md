I didn't used to be a procrastinator, but now that I have 3 kids, I tend to take care of the urgent first.&#160; This means that sometimes my really good plans get altered when real life sets in.&#160;&#160; I have found that if I want to tackle a large project or extra thing (extra being not [laundry](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/13/the-bane-of-my-existence/), [groceries](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/03/31/the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it/), cleaning, cooking... those necessities of life) I need to make a self-imposed deadline in order for it to happen.&#160; It needs its own &quot;urgency&quot; so to speak.

When my first born turned one I made a scrapbook of his first year.&#160; I finished it shortly before his first birthday so I was able to sit it out at his first birthday party for friends and family to skim through.&#160; 2 years later when my daughter was born, I made a similar book for her.&#160; As I sat down every night for a month working on it I told myself with my next child I will work a little each month so I don't have such a monumental task in front of me with three kids vying for my attention at the same time.&#160;&#160; I really intended to work on it a little each month.&#160; 

That's not exactly how book number three happened.&#160; In fact, I didn't even leave myself a month.&#160; I cropped the first picture only one week before her party and I spent every night last week working on her book.&#160; I finished the book at 3 am [the night before her party](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/18/i-am-one-busy-mama-tonight/).&#160; I knew that not many people would look at the book at the party but I also knew that if I didn't sit down and finish it before her party, chances are she would be graduating high school with a half finished baby book.&#160;&#160; So,I cropped, taped, and laid out the pages of her book, driven by this self imposed deadline.&#160; 

![IMG_5391](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/img-5391-thumb.jpg) It worked!&#160; I now have a completed 45 spread baby book for my baby girl.&#160; I know without this goal, I'd be sitting with an empty book right now.&#160; 

The only way I can make progress on &quot;extracurriculars&quot; is by setting goals and working to achieve them.&#160; Often times I give myself a monthly to do list.&#160; This approach works for me, it keeps me from getting defeated when life gets busy.&#160; For other tips that work for others, check out [Rocks in My Dryer.](http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/shannon/)
