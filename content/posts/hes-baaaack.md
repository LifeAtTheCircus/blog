The first time Scott went away on business travel, we were newly married and when he told me he was going to CA for a week, I really thought the world was ending.&#160; Looking back it was one of those classic examples of a couple looking at the same event in two different ways.&#160; For Scott the trip was an exciting opportunity.&#160; A chance to do something new and definitely a plus for his career.&#160; Sure, he would miss me, but it would only be 3 days. To me it was 3 days… also known as the world coming to and end.&#160; What would I do with my husband gone for three days?&#160; How would I survive?&#160; Looking back, I was quite melodramatic.&#160; (clearly I wasn’t cut out to be a military wife)&#160; But, go he did and survive I did. 

8 years later and I still am not a fan of business travel.&#160; Thankfully, he really doesn’t go all that often, a few times a year on average.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I still shed a tear when we kiss goodbye and hate falling asleep in the big lonely bed, but I have come up with a strategy for getting through the time a part. I plan a special event for the kids and I for each day he’s gone. Nothing huge… ice cream cones for dessert, a fun craft, or a fast food dinner.

Though talked up correctly, each can turn into the highlight of our day.&#160; We also typically have a movie and popcorn night planned for one of the evenings.&#160; These little breaks from the norm give us something to look forward to and distract us.&#160;

It helped the kids to see what he was seeing and feel a part of his trip.&#160; The kids would dictate messages for me to e-mail to him and he’d write back.&#160; It really helped keep them connected and was so cute to see their messages to him.&#160; 

**From my youngest**: _Daddy couldn't be here tonight.&#160; Next time won't you sing with me.&#160; Like a diamond in the sky.&#160;_ 

**From my son:**&#160; _Dad, I love your video.&#160; We did have a great time and I love you very much.&#160; I hope you have a good flight on the airplane.&#160; And I think I believe I will be awake when you come home.&#160; I do love you a lot.&#160; Do you think mine is the longest e-mail?&#160; Please write back soon.&#160; I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.&#160; Hey, I'll see you tomorrow.&#160; Tomorrow we're going to have lasagna.&#160; But, can I sit beside you when we have lasagna tomorrow?&#160; Hey, do you know what?&#160; I've got a surprise for you tomorrow for after dinner.&#160; Please write back. I love you.&#160; Goodbye.&#160; 2 thousand and one hundred kisses._

_**From our middle child:** __Dear Daddy, I hope you have a safe trip back.&#160; Don't be scared of the dark b/c you’re flying back on the plane.&#160; Be safe.&#160; Now I hope you have a fine trip back home.&#160; I love you Da Da.&#160; I love you Da Da.&#160;&#160; How can you believe we ate ice cream?_ 

According to the flight status checker online, Scott’s plane is due back in 22 minutes!! I can’t wait for him to walk in the door.&#160; Tomorrow we’ll have a big yummy “Daddy’s home breakfast” with cinnamon rolls, scrambled eggs, and bacon.&#160; And lasagna for dinner.&#160; Celebration!&#160; Daddy’s home!!&#160; All is right with the world again.
