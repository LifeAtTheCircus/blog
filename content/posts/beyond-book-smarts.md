Education is about so much more than book smarts.&#160; I’ve known this for awhile and believed it to my core.&#160; In fact, this fact alone has dictated so many decisions we make in raising our children, especially since we home school and&#160; want to make sure that they are learning more than just “reading, writing, and arithmetic.”

Yesterday and today our school time was “interrupted” so that I could spend time one on one disciplining a child for behavior.&#160; Each time it was a different child.&#160; Each time the issue was about much more than their behavior but the character issue underlining it.&#160; And as you can imagine, each time it took way more time and energy than I truthfully wanted it to.&#160; But, I plowed through.&#160; As I did I recalled a nugget I took from the [parenting DVD](http://www.paultrippministries.com/gettingtotheheartofparenting) I watched [last spring in SS](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2011/04/15/getting-to-the-heart-of-parenting/).&#160;&#160; The speaker said we need to view these situations as “moments of ministry” and GIVE THANKS for the opportunity God has given us&#160; to work on this character issue now… while they are young.&#160; I am so grateful for that perspective change b/c I realize as I home school I am given a unique gift (though I don’t always view it as that in the moment) of extra time with my child to work out these issues.&#160; And I promise you I don’t think a home school day goes by where we don’t have to stop and work on our hearts.&#160; It isn’t quick, it is definitely not painless and I too often wonder when or if we’ll see the end result.&#160; It is my prayer though that through these battles and through these discussions, God will use them to mold and shape our hearts to be like His. 

I know that these battles wouldn’t have arisen had they been in a regular classroom this morning. And yet, that doesn’t mean that those underlining character issues wouldn’t still be there.&#160; And so, in a strange way I am grateful for those outbursts and the opportunity they provide for us to work on character.&#160; I am hopeful that God will use them to draw each of us closer to Him and I am thankful for His grace despite my many, many shortcomings as Mom and Teacher.

 _I left today’s battle in need of some chocolate… I didn’t have time to mix up those cookies yet but after we got some more school work done and broke for lunch I was blessed with some&#160; time to blare some praise music on Pandora while making mac and cheese… it was just what my soul needed.&#160; It’s quiet/nap time now and I think I’m going to mix up those cookies (or at least eat some cookie dough) before we hit the books again this afternoon.&#160;&#160;&#160;_
