[![_240_360_Book.165.cover](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/240_360_Book.165.cover.jpg "_240_360_Book.165.cover")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/240_360_Book.165.cover_.jpg) When it comes to books and movies, one favorite category of mine is crime drama.&#160; If the back cover mentions CIA, FBI, or any other government agency, you can bet I’d give it a try.&#160; I was quite excited when I had the opportunity to read an advanced copy of [Lis Wiehl’s](http://www.liswiehlbooks.com/ .) book
 Hand of Fate 
and review it on my blog.&#160; 

The book centers on 3 friends, (one a crime reporter, one a federal prosecutor, and the other an FBI agent) as they work together to solve the death of radio talk show personality, Jim Fate.&#160; His death prompted panic in the city of Portland, OR, as terrorism was suspected.&#160;&#160; This type of book is right up my alley.&#160; 

The book was a quick read.&#160; I easily read it in two evenings.&#160; It wasn’t overly captivating, and I must confess I did not find myself staying awake all night to finish it, like I have with some other crime dramas.&#160; Though I will say that I didn’t&#160; expect the ending.&#160; I love when books have a surprise twist at the end and it didn’t disappoint with that.&#160;&#160; 

To be honest, I’d give it a 4 out of 10.&#160; Not bad for a night or two of entertainment, but not in my top 5 of fiction crime novels either.&#160;&#160; The book is her second in her Triple Threat novel series.&#160; After reading this one, I’d be interested in going back and reading the first book.&#160;&#160;
