I’m always looking for something to spice things up here at the circus.&#160; And this year I think the kids are old enough to really enjoy some pranks tomorrow for April Fools.&#160;&#160; 

I was delighted to open my recent addition of [Family Fun magazine](http://www.familyfun.com) and find some fun little pranks to pull on the little ones.&#160; All sweet innocent fun!

So, tomorrow we’ll be having some [arctic cereal](http://familyfun.go.com/arts-and-crafts/season/feature/april-fools-funnies/april-fools-funnies6.html). ( The night before April Fools' day, pour milk over half a bowl of cereal and put it in the freezer. In the morning, add a covering of more cereal and milk. Call your child to breakfast and watch him try to eat it.)

And for dinner we’ll be having [cupcakes](http://jas.familyfun.go.com/recipefinder/display?id=50154)…or so they think.

I MAY through in some dirt for dessert, depending on how the day pans out.&#160; They’ve had it before, but love it and it seems like a fun finish to a silly day.&#160; 

What about you?&#160; Got any fun pranks up your sleeves for tomorrow?&#160; Click [here](http://familyfun.go.com/aprilfools/), if your looking for some more inspiration!
