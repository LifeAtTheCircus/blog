By the third time around, one would think that a gal would have the whole labor thing down pat. 

One would think….

About a week or so before my due date, I started having contractions…nothing super painful, but enough to make we wonder, “What if this ends up being it?”&#160; [This time around the van was vacuumed](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/05/06/flashback-friday-labor-stories-part-2/) well in advance, so no early morning trips to the gas station for Scott to clean the car before heading to the doctors.&#160; BUT, we didn’t get a good shot of my belly towards the end of the pregnancy.&#160; (_Seems I’ve discovered there is always SOMETHING to stress about right before having a baby_).&#160;&#160; So, at 3am I woke Scott to 
tell him I was in labor
 ask him to take my picture.&#160;&#160; 

Yes, I was freaking out that the contractions would turn into real contractions and by that point I wouldn’t feel like posing for a cute preggo belly shot and then this poor child would be the only one without a picture in Momma’s belly. 

So, I brushed my hair, changed clothes, and freshened up my make up at **3 am** so we could take the all important profile belly shot.&#160; 

Here it is:&#160; (_This picture is saved on our hard drive in a folder my husband entitled Neurotic Crystal_).

Turns out the contractions went away and we could have waited till morning to take this shot.&#160; But, really, what kind of story would that make?

Several days later the contractions returned.&#160; I was fairly certain 
this was it 
so we called my in laws to come and watch the kids and off to the hospital we went. 

Only as we drove to the hospital, we noticed that my contractions were slowing down.&#160; 

NOOOOOO!!!!!

By the time we made the long 10 min trek to the hospital both of us had a sinking suspicion, _this wasn’t it_.&#160;&#160; So we walked around the hospital.&#160; We walked the halls for awhile, then decided to walk around the perimeter of the building.&#160; We must have looked ridiculous to anyone who saw us, as this 9 mth pregnant women was walking around the parking lots and parking garages.&#160;&#160; Eventually we went to the Dr office b/c I knew there was no reason to go to triage.&#160; 

But, we switched OB’s yet again after delivering my daughter, and this practice oddly wouldn’t admit me if I wasn’t in real labor.&#160; In fact, they wouldn’t even see me.&#160; 

So, home we went… I of course cried the whole way home because I felt stupid and because I wanted this to be it and it wasn’t and did I mention, I felt stupid?&#160;&#160; Scott took me out for bagels then we went home.&#160; Scott stuck around awhile to play with the kids while I took a nap.&#160; _He really is the world’s best husband._ 

2 days later I had some friends over… the kids were all out on the back deck and the moms were talking…I noticed the contractions coming back again, but wasn’t going to get my hopes up too much.&#160; My friends stuck around awhile and I confided to one that I thought, _this might be it_.&#160; It was in fact 2 days after my due date and all.&#160;&#160; We fed the kids, cleaned up lunch, everyone left and I put my 2 down for naps.&#160; I called Scott b/c at this point they were pretty regular and consistent.&#160;&#160;&#160; Scott came home a little while later and we knew _this was it._&#160;&#160; 

We called for back up to watch the kiddos as we got ready to go to the hospital, but none of the people we had lined up were answering their phones.&#160; We got a hold of Scott’s dad at work, an hour away, and he promised to head straight to our house.&#160; We kept calling to see if we could find anyone closer to help.&#160; Eventually, we got a hold of Scott’s grandparents. They kindly offered to come to our house and wait with the kids while Scott’s dad drove to the house.&#160; We assured them it shouldn’t be too hard as we just put the kids down for naps. 

Of course when they got to our house, I was bowled over with contractions and my daughter wasn’t napping but instead was crying.&#160;&#160; We apologetically handed her off to Scott’s grandpa and to the hospital we went. 

At the hospital they confirmed I was 3 cm dilated and having contractions.&#160; Though my contractions were not consistent.&#160; I was sent to walk the halls.&#160; I was admitted and they broke my water.&#160; I then got the epidural.&#160; 

Life was good.&#160; 

(We discovered through watching my contractions on the monitor that my contractions never really get consistent, even at the very end).&#160; About 4 and half hours after going to triage, I was ready to push.&#160; The nurse called the doc and he promptly came in the room.&#160; As he was putting on his gloves, the nurse told me to take a practice push.&#160; The doc looked over from across the room and said, “No more practicing… I see the head!”&#160; **3 pushes later and we had our baby girl!!&#160; [![IMG_2822](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_2822.jpg "IMG_2822")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_2822.jpg)** 

It was love at first sight for all of us.&#160; [![Big Happy Family](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/BigHappyFamily.jpg "Big Happy Family")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/BigHappyFamily.jpg)
