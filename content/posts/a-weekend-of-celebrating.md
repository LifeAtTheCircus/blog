What a full and festive weekend we had here at the circus!&#160; Friday night Scott and I got all dressed up for a fun and fancy Christmas party!&#160; We got to enjoy tasty appetizers, holiday drinks, and the opportunity to sit and chat with old friends.&#160; A super way to start the weekend.&#160; (Though the baby did not like the cheese dip I ate too much of and I paid for that with an upset stomach later that night).&#160; 

Saturday we went to my in-laws to watch the Army/Navy game.&#160; My FIL is a Naval Academy grad and my brother in law is serving in the Army in Iraq.&#160;&#160; We route for Navy out of our devotion to Pop, but totally understand why baby Eli cheers for Army to support his Daddy.&#160;&#160; Then Pop, [Aunt Karen, and baby Eli](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/) joined us in downtown Annapolis to watch the boat light parade and fireworks display.&#160; A good time was had by all, though my youngest does not like the fireworks.&#160; The noise scares her and she has found the best way to deal with this is to bury her head in our arms and not look.&#160; Somehow not looking at them makes it all better.&#160;

Sunday was a much needed low key day.&#160; We had church in the morning and a very leisurely Sunday afternoon.&#160; Naps, followed by a [Christmas cartoon](http://www.amazon.com/Very-First-Noel-Steve-Twitchell/dp/B000JMKKI6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1260760920&amp;sr=8-1), followed by decorating our gingerbread house.&#160;&#160;&#160; After the kids went to bed, Scott and I topped off the relaxing day with a quiet dinner of grilled steaks and watching [The Nativity](http://www.amazon.com/Nativity-Story-Keisha-Castle-Hughes/dp/B000MGBM1I) story.&#160; 

 A perfect weekend from start to finish!
