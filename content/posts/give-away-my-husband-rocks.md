How often do you plan something special just for your hubbie?  No, not your anniversary or his birthday, but just because you love him?  

While I was at the MOPS convention last month, there was a woman there promoting [The Husband Project](http://www.thehusbandproject.org/).   Curious, I stopped by her booth.  The husband project is basically a guideline for helping wives to focus on their husbands needs.  The project is designed to last for 3 weeks.  They have a different project for you to do for your husband each of the 21 days and one bonus project for each week.  The ladies on my MOPS leadership team thought this sounded like an excellent idea.  So each of us is going through "the project" right now and we plan to organize an event this spring so that all of the ladies in our MOPS group has the chance to participate. 

The projects are not elaborate or expensive.  Some require more planning than others and all of them help you to focus more on your hubby. 

I must admit that I thought I did a pretty good job of focusing on Scott, in fact some of the projects are things that I do regularly for Scott already.  But, this project has already opened my eyes to find new ways in which I could focus on my husband and made me realize how much I often take him for granted.  

Today I sent this e-mail to Scott at work. 
 > **Subject:** guess what i did?  
> i just gave Maggie a bath... it had been a long time and it is something i typically leave for you so I thought one way i could speak your language today was by giving her a bath.  :-)    
> i love you! 

I've mentioned before that Scott's [love language](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/02/weekend-thoughts-the-best-book-i-never-read/) is acts of service.  Today's assigned project had nothing to do with this, but I got the idea in my head and decided to make it a bonus act.  No reason to limit myself to one act right?  It took about 30 minutes, but this simple act meant a lot to my hubby.  Check out the e-mail I received back from him later that afternoon.  > 
> You TOTALLY did speak my language just now.  I want to tell someone how happy I am but I am afraid it would be lost on them.  In that sense I have to agree words translate better :-) 

I don't know that I would have thought of doing this if I hadn't been working on the husband project right now.  I am excited about setting aside three weeks to spend extra time and energy on Scott.  As a busy SAHM with three preschoolers, it takes intentional effort sometimes.   
In honor of this project, I have a give a way for all of you.   Another booth I visited at the MOPS convention was a tee shirt booth called [From Me Tees](http://www.frommetees.com/) where I purchased my very own tee shirt to wear with pride for my hubby.  In fact all 5 ladies that attended from my group, bought shirts for their hubbies and we proudly wore them home on Sunday for the guys to see when they picked us up at the airport.  We had to get up at 3:30am to make our flight that morning, so please pardon our expressions in this shot if we look a bit tired.

I was surprise at how many comments we received from people when they saw our shirts.  One man said to me, "It's so nice to see ladies making a positive statement about their husbands for a change."  It was neat to see the response our shirts drew from total strangers.  
I contacted the lovely gal who designs these shirts and she has graciously offered to give one commenter their choice of either a daisy tee or one of the original "my husband rocks" tees in either hot pink or chocolate brown!!  So, if you are interested in the chance to win a shirt that is sure to make your hubby smile, check out her site at the link below and then be sure to 
leave me a comment telling **why your husband rocks**
  by noon on Friday and I will chose one random commenter to receive a free shirt!
