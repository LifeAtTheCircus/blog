The concept of time is a funny thing.&#160; Who can really grasp it?&#160; On one&#160; hand it seems like ages ago that I brought my little one home from the hospital, and at the same time it feels just like yesterday.&#160; How does one go about teaching the concept of time to little ones?&#160; To them a day truly is like a thousand years!&#160; 

I read somewhere that its helpful to give children a specific time (as in you have 10 minutes to play and then we are cleaning up) then set the timer and when the timer goes off, clean up.&#160; They will then start to grasp a better understanding of time.&#160; It doesn’t work if you don’t set the timer and then fail to follow through on the end time.&#160; I’ve use this lots both in my classroom and with my children.&#160; Egg timers are a mommy and teacher’s best friend!

But, I’ve also found something else that works particularly well for my kiddos.&#160; I explain units of time in concepts they can truly comprehend.&#160; T.V. Shows

Each day my son has quiet time for 1.5 hrs while his sisters nap.&#160; “How long is an hour and a half?” he asks.&#160; “One episode of Sesame Street and one episode of Spiderman.”&#160; I reply. 

&quot;Kids,” I say one morning,&quot;School starts in 15 minutes.”&#160; “How long is that they reply,”&#160; “You know how each episode of Word World has two stories?&#160; It’s one story,”&#160; I answer.&#160; 

So I am pretty much limited to time limits of 15 minutes (one portion of Word World, George the Monkey, or Clifford)&#160; or 30 minutes (Spiderman, Dora, or Sid the Science Kid) or one hour (Sesame Street), or any combination of the above.&#160; 

Last night the kids asked how long till we get there and my husband called to the back of the minivan “45 minutes… like one Curious George less than&#160; Sesame Street).&#160;
