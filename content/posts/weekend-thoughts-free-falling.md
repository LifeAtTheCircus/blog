My youngest child is fearless.&#160; 

FEARLESS

When we go to the playground she’s off and running, climbing to the top of the big slide, coming and going without looking back.&#160;&#160; She’ll slide down the stairs of my house with the speed of a bob sled racer.&#160;&#160; She tries very hard to keep up with her older siblings and she does it well.

The other day we were at a cookout and the kids were clamoring around a tree stump catching toads.&#160;&#160; My friend wondered how my little girl would do in a trust fall.&#160;&#160; So, Daddy stuck her up on the stump and had her fall backwards into his arms.&#160; 

She went without hesitation.&#160; 

Like almost every thing with our crew, once one kid does it the others want to follow in suit.&#160; The older two then followed.&#160; 

But unlike their little sister, they looked back the first time to make sure Daddy was there. 

As my friends and I were looking on we wondered if my youngest gals ability to free fall was truly trust or if it was due to her fearless nature or her age.&#160; 

While her leap of faith may have looked more impressive, I think it was my cautious son that actually displayed true trust.&#160; As he stood up on that tree stump, he recognized how high he was.&#160; And he looked back to see if Daddy was there to catch him.&#160; Once he saw him, he fell freely into his Daddy’s arms trusting that he would indeed catch him when he fell.

Why?

Not because he is my daredevil who loves a good thrill.&#160; 

Because his Daddy has proven himself worthy of his trust over the past 5 years.&#160; His Daddy is a man of his word.&#160; If he says, he’ll catch him, my son knew he would.&#160; His Daddy is strong.&#160; He’s held him in his arms before, carried him high and never let him go.&#160; 

And so, my son trusted him and fell back into his arms.

It reminds me of myself and my heavenly Father.&#160; I’ve known the Lord most of my life.&#160;&#160; I have seen His hand of providence time and time again.&#160; And I know God is who He says he is. 

So, when I face situations where I need to trust him I can.&#160; Not because I don’t know the stakes.&#160; Not because I have no fear.&#160; But because I know that my heavenly Father is always there to catch me in his most capable arms.&#160;
