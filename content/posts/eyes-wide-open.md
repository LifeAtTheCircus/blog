When you have a baby people offer you all sorts of odd, unsolicited, terrifying, and often contradictory pieces of advice.&#160; One that I have heard over and over the past 9 years is “Don’t blink.” 

And I have tried really hard not to. 

I have tried really hard to savor the chaos.&#160;&#160; It’s a large part of the reason why I blog.&#160; I want to record the every day.&#160; The funny things they say, the crazy outfits they pick out, the battles we engage in, the toys they love… and yes, even the unending laundry pile,&#160; and the sink overflowing with dishes… Because I know what those who have gone before me have told me is true… the days are long, but the years are quick.&#160; Before you know it, those chubby little hands turn into bony fingers and knees… While I will always be their Momma, and they will always be my babies, I won’t always have the luxury of time with them every day.&#160; And so, I try, I TRY to remember it is a luxury… and a short lived one and I try to embrace it. 

This year, I feel like Scott and I literally watched my oldest son grow up RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES.&#160; 

We didn’t blink. 

I swear, we watched it happen.&#160; 

And whether you blink or not, there is no stopping it. 

The year from 8-9 has been so monumental it seems.&#160;&#160; He hasn’t been my baby for awhile, and he left toddlerhood years ago. But he’s been in school long enough, that we’ve past the early elementary years.&#160; He’s a full fledged school aged kid, well on his way to middle school.&#160;&#160; 

*insert freak out here*

He’s gotten taller.&#160; He comes up to my shoulder now. 

He finds girls and love&#160; gross and disgusting.&#160; 

He has a sense of humor.&#160; He gets sarcasm.&#160; 

He’s genuinely helpful around the house.&#160; A few weeks ago, he helped Scott spread 20 yards of mulch over a weekend.&#160; He literally worked by Scott’s side for 11 hours.&#160; Never asking if he was done… never looking for a way out.&#160; It was a monumental weekend because it was the first time I think he truly grasped the value and the joy that comes from a job well done.&#160; 

He loves to read… this year The Hardy Boys and The Hobbit have been personal favorites of his.&#160; 

While he is maturing in so many ways, he still loves fantasy and his current obsession is The Lord of the Rings.&#160; He loves dressing up and using his imagination.&#160; 

He loves playing outside.&#160; 

And I gotta tell you, I am proud of the young man he is growing up to be.&#160; He’s sensitive and thoughtful.&#160; He’s respectful.&#160; He has integrity.&#160; He’s a leader.&#160;&#160; He loves his younger sisters and brother and truly, truly, I couldn’t have picked a better big brother for them.&#160;&#160; He’s a loyal friend. 

I marvel at the ways he’s grown over the past 9 years and I thank the Lord for His work in his life.&#160; I see it so clearly and it humbles me and brings me to my knees in gratitude.&#160;&#160;

My son as you open your gifts this year, I hope you know how immensely grateful Daddy and I are for the gift of you that the Lord so graciously gave us 9 years ago.&#160;
