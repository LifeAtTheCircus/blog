We celebrated our son’s 9th birthday this weekend at the Shire.&#160; Our son has been quite taken by The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings this year.&#160; His attention was sparked by the Lego LOTR game, then Scott and him read the Hobbit and he is now reading The Fellowship of the Ring.&#160; For his cake, he requested a volcano to look like Mt. Doom.

The kids pulled together some costumes… We have from left to right, Gimli, Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, and Aragorn.&#160;

And Scott pulled off a Gandalf costume thanks to a moving van blanket and an old tee shirt.&#160;

I love the Gimli costume my oldest son put together for his little brother.&#160; I love it because it illustrates two of the things I love about my 9 year old… his creativity (shaping a costume out of oversized shirts) and his love for his little brother.&#160; He shaped the hair and beard out of his poloshirt.&#160; And I was so thankful that my 2 year old was willing to cooperate with his big brother’s costume selection.&#160; _Because we all know 2 year old aren’t known for cooperation._

I don’t know much about Lord of the Rings… Middle Earth, hobbits or elves.&#160; But, thanks to the help of the internet and the dollar store, I was able to pull together some décor and games.&#160;&#160; 

The highlight for the birthday boy was battling his dad.&#160; I must say, that Scott is at his element when it comes to the kids birthday parties.&#160; I might pool together a list of food, game, and décor ideas , but&#160; Scott is able to transform into whatever character fits the theme of the party and he makes it come to life.&#160; Today he was Gandalph the Gray leading the kids in a reenactment of the story, then transforming to Sarumon so the kids could attack him (their favorite part).

Here they are weaving through a spider web in our hallway.

More pretend play in the backyard.

I just love my sons imagination.&#160; And I loved watching him play with his friends at his party.
