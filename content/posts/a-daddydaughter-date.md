Then it was out to lunch at the American Girl doll store (or the Molly store as she called it to me when she was describing later that day).&#160;&#160; 

_(OK so we don’t have American Girl dolls here yet… but we did work things out so that she she could borrow one for lunch that day, since she didn’t have one of her own.)_

She was quite excited to discover they both had brown hair and glasses.

and they both were wearing the same shoes…

Filling up Molly’s cup so she could offer her a sip

From what I gathered, Scott was the best Daddy ever… totally engaging Molly and hamming up the whole event for our daughter.&#160; In fact, later that day, he even called Molly on his cell phone b/c she had one more question for her.&#160; 

![IMG_9328](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_9328.jpg "IMG_9328")I don’t know all that they discussed in their lunch together.&#160; But, I do know that they enjoyed each other and that’s what’s important.&#160; In a family with 4 kids, one on one time between a parent and child, is a rare and treasured gift.&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

My heart kept smiling all day as he’d send me little text messages with pictures of their time together.&#160;

I think they both truly enjoyed their time together and made some memories which they’ll both cherish for a long time coming.&#160;
