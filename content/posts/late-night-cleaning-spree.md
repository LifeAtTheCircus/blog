The other night I came up to kiss the girls goodnight and found them voluntarily cleaning their room.&#160; 

And folks,I don’t mean stuffing toys under their beds and clothes down the laundry shoot.&#160; I found them in the closet sorting and they asked me for a laundry basket and a trashcan.&#160;&#160; It was already past their bed time, but they were clearly in the cleaning mode.&#160; 

And I know when it comes to things like Deep Cleaning you gotta embrace the mood when it hits.&#160; So, I said, “Here you go, go to town girls, but stay quiet.”

When I peeked in on them later I found them asleep in an truly immaculate bedroom, with these piles at their door.[![piles](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/piles.jpg "piles")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/piles.jpg)

My type A sorter LOVES piles… everything is always in piles or bags… at first glance it can sometimes look like clutter, but there is almost always a system in place.&#160; 

I LOVED the labels on the piles.&#160; I learned the next morning, that the piles were left for me to put away… clearly labeled with where it all went.&#160; Ha! Here are the piles…

Middle Floor
