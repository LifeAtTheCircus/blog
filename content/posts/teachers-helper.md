My daughter really is a very patient teacher’s assistant.&#160; She will sit quietly without ever saying a word and listen to her big brother as he sounds out the words to read the Bible story each night.&#160; It is quite precious.

 And the other day I discovered that having her quiz him on flashcards is the perfect way to let her be involved in school.&#160; She happily sits and holds the cards up for him and will praise him when he gets the answers correct.
