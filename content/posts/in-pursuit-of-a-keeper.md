 They’ve tried piers, ponds, worms, and lures.&#160; For three summers now he’s patiently pursued it.&#160; Casting and waiting.&#160; Enjoying the view and the time together.&#160; 

Each time, I’d ask if he had a good time.&#160; Each time he’d enthusiastically respond, “Yes!”&#160; Then I’d ask if he got a keeper and each time he’d respond in the negative.&#160; 

He’s caught a fish a few times, but not the illustrious keeper he sought after.&#160;&#160; However, it didn’t dampen his resolve or his love of fishing.

And finally, the waiting paid off.

They cleaned it up and fried it right there on Nana and Pop’s boat.
