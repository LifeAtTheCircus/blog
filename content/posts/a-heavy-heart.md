I learned this weekend that a friend and former MOPS mentor mom of mine passed away suddenly in her sleep.&#160; The suddenness and surprise of her passing took me quite off guard.&#160; My heart has been so heavy since I heard the news.&#160; 

Aside from my grandparents who both suffered long illnesses before their death,&#160; this is really the first person close to me that I’ve known whose died.&#160; She wasn’t just a person that I recognized or said Hi to on Sunday morning.&#160;&#160; She was a friend.&#160; 

This women hosted our steering meetings month after month in her home.&#160; She even hosted our entire steering retreat in her home (when she was out of town).&#160; She always said, “this is God’s house, use it, please use it!”&#160;&#160; Honestly, that was how she lived her life.&#160; She was a true servant.&#160; For as long as I knew her she was always actively and joyfully serving and leading in our church.&#160; She loved her husband and was a true example to us all of a godly wife.&#160; She loved her children and grandchildren and talked of them often.&#160;&#160;&#160; Most importantly, most vividly, she loved her Lord and she was such a transparent example to us of a woman who whole heartedly served God with her life.&#160;&#160; She always a had a big smile, and hug for each of us.&#160; During my leadership in MOPS, I went through a particularly difficult circumstance as a leader, and she walked with me through it.&#160; She was a huge source of support and encouragement to me as I stepped into my role as leader of our group.&#160;&#160; I am thankful for the chance I had to learn and grow from her.&#160; I am thankful for the impact and influence she’s had on my life and the lives of so many other ladies I know.&#160;&#160; She leaves behind her a godly legacy of a true and faithful servant and she is missed greatly by all who had the pleasure of knowing her.
