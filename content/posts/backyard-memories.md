It was 3 years ago this month that we accidentally stumbled across our house.  

And we fell in love with it. 

There are many things I appreciate about our house, but it was the backyard that captured my heart.  And truthfully still holds my heart 3 years later.   When Scott looks back there, he often is just overwhelmed with the work that needs to be done…. but I guess since those chores don’t typically fall on my plate, I honestly never see them.  

Instead I see this….

I had been thinking of going in to DC yesterday to see the Cherry Blossoms…our schedule was open, the weather was gorgeous and the blooms were at their peak.  But, then I just felt like resting… like going nowhere, doing nothing and just being home.

The kids were out back pretty much from when we got home from church until it was time for baths and bed. 

It wasn’t a particularly notable day… the boys rode bikes and skateboards, the girls made up a routine on the trampoline and then they asked to build a fire and play wiffle ball.

And while it wasn’t anything noteworthy, no epic adventure, no picture perfect poses, as I went to bed last night I couldn’t help but think that when they are old and grown, it was exactly the kind of day I hoped they remembered from their childhood.
