6 years ago, I was also carrying a baby in my belly.&#160;&#160; (In fact, this picture was taken exactly 6 yrs ago to the date).&#160; 

The nursery was prepped, the hospital bag had long been packed.&#160;&#160; I was basically sitting around waiting to have a baby. I do not recommend going with that strategy… what a long week of waiting that was.&#160; Now I try to plan things right up to and past the due date, so I am not in that hurry up and wait mode.&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

I had no idea how my world was going to change in the next week.&#160; You think you know, you think your ready, but until that moment arrives and you’re holding that precious new life in your arms, you just don’t know.&#160; [![Birthday 034b](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Birthday034b.jpg "Birthday 034b")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Birthday034b.jpg) 

Even though my son slept like a log that first night, I barely slept at all.&#160; You know how babies hit that deep sleep, and you can’t wake them for anything, shortly after being born?&#160; I know wisdom would have had me sleeping while he slept, but I just kept staring at him.&#160; Wondering what he’d be like when he grew up.&#160; What would he&#160; like to do?&#160; What would we play?&#160; I just kept staring at him.&#160; My heart was full to overflowing with gratitude and happiness.&#160; Scott and I kept singing him songs and praying and pondering this new little person in our arms.&#160;&#160;

I can’t believe 6 years have come and gone already.&#160; His personality and gifting have really started to shine through.&#160; We’ve passed infancy, toddlerhood and preschool.&#160; He’s almost a first grader!&#160; He’s a big brother (3 times over).&#160; He has a real and passionate relationship with God.&#160; He loves baseball and fishing.&#160; He’s a deep thinker and has an amazing memory.&#160; He’s one of the most thoughtful and patient little guys I’ve ever met.&#160; He is detail oriented and loves to draw and color.&#160; He is not a risk taker.&#160;&#160; He is literal and sees the world in black and white with no room for grey.&#160;&#160; 

6 years have come and gone and I still find myself overwhelmed with gratitude and thanksgiving.&#160; I still ponder his future and wonder about the man he will become.&#160; I still can’t believe that I have the privilege of being his mom.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; [![IMG_7149](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_7149.jpg "IMG_7149")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_7149.jpg) 

So much has changed, and yet so much is still very much the same.&#160;
