Only 2 days till Christmas and my to do list today looks like this.

1.  Clean bathroom- scrub toilet, scrub sink, scrub tub and tile (I write each individually so I can feel more satisfaction when I am done by crossing off 4 things instead of one)
2.  Clean guestroom-&#160; My parents always say, don’t worry or stress about cleaning up for them.&#160; And I appreciate the fact that I can keep things real and not stress out, but… I think I need to clear off a place for them to sleep, don’t you? ![IMG_4536](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMG_4536.jpg "IMG_4536")
3.  Take kids to see Santa (not usually on my to do list as they see him at Scott’s Family work party but this year when they snapped the pic at the party my son wasn’t ready and after we got home he came out that night in tears asking if we could go again b/c he wasn’t ready for the picture) I of course told him I’d take him to the mall before Christmas so he could see Santa again… and here we are on the 23rd and I still need to make good on that promise.

4.  Finish shopping for extended family
5.  Take kids shopping for each other
6.  Decorate cookies we baked last night![IMG_4501](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMG_4501.jpg "IMG_4501")
7.  Finish stringing cranberry and popcorn on tree
8.  wrap presents (this may get moved to tomorrow as Scott and I typically wrap gifts after church on Christmas Eve while watching It’s a Wonderful Life… sometimes I think we’ll be on top of things and do it early, don’t think 2009 will be that year)
9.  buy a few grocery items for Christmas brunch and dinner  

&#160;

The time is now 1:39 and I can cross off item number 3.

&#160;

The kids are fed and down for nap/quiet time and I ate my lunch… I’d say it’s time to get off of the computer and see what else I can cross off before Scott gets home from work this afternoon!
