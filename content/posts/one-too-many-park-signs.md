When we'd been married a little over a year when we set out on a cross country vacation to take in National Parks, a few new cities, time with family, and a visit with friends.    Because we are scrapbook geeks or maybe just geeks, we decided it would be fun to pose in front of each national park sign.  

At first we posed like normal people, you know arm around each other all cute and coupley...

But 7 days and who knows how many miles later and we thought it would be fun to pose creatively...  (get it we "are the arch" with the real arch inside)

Once this crazy theme started, it just got worse with each additional hour riding in the car.... (Here we are posing as a mountain at Rocky Mt National park, before digital cameras hence the only pic we took was a fuzzy one).

Yes, it really can get worse.... as we do our Mt Rushmore impersonation...

But the worse was by far Wind Cave National Park.  As we drove through Wind Cave all we saw were buffalo and prairie dogs.  (Turns out the real attraction at the park was the caves underneath, which we somehow missed). I am not sure which one of us came up with this great idea, but we thought to "keep it fun" we'd pose as a buffalo and prairie dog in front of the park sign.

Because we are THAT cool!

The worst part is we've kept up on our ambition to visit every National Park and we have a frame in our guest room which holds each National Park sign photo.  So, yes when friends and family come to visit they get to see this shockingly scary photo of me posing as a prairie dog.
