Last week at church they gave an advertisement for our upcoming Vacation Bible School.&#160;&#160; I was a few minutes late so I missed the announcement.&#160; When I sat down my son said, “I do not want to go to VBS this year!”&#160; 

I couldn’t figure out why.&#160; My son said, “It’s not going to be anything like last year… it’s an adventure camp.”&#160; 

Figuring he must have been intimidated by the adjectives they used to describe it, I told him it is going to be really fun. 

“No Mom,” he said, “you don’t know, they said this is not your Mom’s VBS.”

At this point I had to chuckle.&#160; Having not heard the announcement, I could only surmise what they said and just had to laugh at how their clever wording and advertising completely turned off my very literal 6 yr old. 

I am now working very hard to overcome the pulpit announcement and convince my son that it will be a lot like last year and even though it’s not your Mom’s VBS, and therefore I seem to have no expertise with which to draw on to make this claim, it really will be fun.&#160; 

We’ve got 6 weeks till Vacation Bible School…wish me luck!
