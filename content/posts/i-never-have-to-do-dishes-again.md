I recently discovered a way to entertain and delight my children, while also getting some help in the kitchen.&#160; 

I let them wash dishes in the sink by hand.&#160;

I don’t give them anything fragile.&#160;&#160; But at almost 3 and almost 5, they are quite capable of scrubbing pots and pans or large bowls…things I can’t squeeze into the dishwasher.&#160; 

They beg me for the opportunity and it keeps them content for up an hour. I figure I gotta take advantage of this while I can…having my kids beg for the chance to do the dishes is not something I anticipate lasting forever.&#160;&#160; 

I’ve learned a few tricks to keep this successful.

*   One child is on dish duty at a time.&#160; (2 preschoolers at the sink is recipe for trouble).&#160;
*   Be prepared to go through more than your usual amount of soap.&#160; Seems the kids think you need a LOT of soap to clean those pots.
*   I limit them to two or three dishes.&#160; I don’t want them to be overwhelmed or to get bored…bored kids armed with the spray house is another hazard.
*   Remove any important papers at least 3 feet away from the sink…splashing is par for the course.
*   Sometimes you gotta spot check them b/c even though they scrub that pot for 30 minutes, they can still miss quite a few spots.&#160; (I typically sit them on the counter to dry and to a quick touch up later when they aren’t around)&#160; They are still getting most of the hard work out of the way with all that soaking.&#160;
