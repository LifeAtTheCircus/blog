Mark your calendars now for the 2024 Olympics… our little gymnast has started training!&#160; [![IMG_8550](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_8550.jpg "IMG_8550")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_8550.jpg)

I must say I have truly enjoyed watching her at her gymnastics class this year.&#160; Since I can’t even do a forward roll, I am always so amazed as I watch her do back rolls or “flip overs” on the bars.&#160; Neither Scott nor I did gymnastics growing up so it is not a sport we would have normally thought of but she is so short, strong and flexible (remember she still [sleeps folded in half](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/10/06/not-much-has-changed/)) that [we just had to get her involved](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/09/02/her-chance-to-shine/).&#160; Add to that her 
f
earlessness 
[and toughness](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/01/12/she-really-is-super-girl/)


 and I think you have all the attributes one looks for in a gymnast (and a whole lot of attributes her mom does not share).

 She’s had a ton of fun this year at gymnastics and it turns out our intuition was right.&#160; This summer she was invited to the join the precompetition class for the next session.   

Perhaps one day we’ll see her on another medal stand? [![IMG_8611](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_8611.jpg "IMG_8611")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_8611.jpg)
