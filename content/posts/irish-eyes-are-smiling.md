When you start the day with a bowl of our traditional St Patty’s day breakfast of Lucky Charms, you know it’s going to be a good day. 

And today was just that. 

I was so excited to have St Patrick’s Day fall on a Saturday this year.&#160; After our magically delicious breakfast, Scott took the big 3 to my son’s baseball practice.&#160; I stayed home to make our lunch (shamrock shaped soft pretzels) while our youngest took a morning cat nap.&#160; 

Then, Scott texted me this picture. [![photo (6)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-6.jpg "photo (6)")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-6.jpg)

Can you believe it?&#160; I’ve never found a four leaf clover and Scott helped the girls find one on St Patrick’s Day no less!!  _Luck of the Irish, perhaps?_

&#160;

You better believe I’ll be using [this recipe](http://www.sprinklesofparsley.com/2011/01/homemade-auntie-annes-pretzels.html) again! We topped them off with mint chocolate chip milkshakes for a deliciously green inspired lunch!

In the afternoon, we met some friends in

&#160;
 Easton, MD for their St Patrick’s Day parade. [![IMG_2623](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2623.jpg "IMG_2623")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2623.jpg)

 It’s my second time visiting Easton and it did not disappoint.&#160; I loved the town, I loved the 3 school bands that performed, the decorated golf carts, the 
gaudy
 green attire lining the streets.&#160; I found myself grinning from ear to ear the entire time and seriously contemplating a visit to the local real estate office.&#160; It was that charming (or I am that much of a sap for small town parades).![IMG_2624](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2624.jpg "IMG_2624")

The weather was gorgeous.&#160;&#160; The afternoon was relaxing (more so for some of us). [![IMG_2645](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2645.jpg "IMG_2645")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2645.jpg)

But, then he requested a ride of his own.

I came home smiling having enjoyed a festive day of family fun with my family. [![IMG_2581](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2581.jpg "IMG_2581")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2581.jpg)
