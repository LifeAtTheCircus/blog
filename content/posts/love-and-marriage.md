I remember when my son was in kindergarten he came home and told me he asked a girl in his class to marry him.&#160; “What did she say?”&#160; I responded. “No. So I told her,why don’t we wait till we are older to decide.”&#160;&#160; I cautioned him that should he ever want to propose again, he should talk to us first and then talk to the girls parents first. 

 I remember this so vividly b/c I knew, I knew there would come a day when he would balk at such a discussion.

And apparently that day fell somewhere in the third grade.&#160; I don’t remember when, but sometime this year, kissing and girls and love and marriage all became totally disgusting to him.&#160; Watching Mom or Dad give each other a quick peck is one of the most horrible, grossest sights known to man…. or at least this 8 year old man.&#160;&#160; 

And I know, just like I knew back in kindergarten that it won’t be like this forever.&#160; 

However, his little sister doesn’t know this.&#160; 

One night as she was getting ready for bed she started crying and said, “Oh Mommy what are we going to do?&#160; What will “my brother”&#160; do if he’s all alone with no one to love him?&#160; If he never gets married, who will he have to love him and be with him?”&#160; I assured my tearful 5 year old that if he decides to never get married, he’ll still have us.&#160; He won’t be all alone b/c we will still love and care for him.&#160; 

Then this weekend at my parents I heard her telling my Dad how her brother “is never going to get married b/c he doesn’t want to kiss…But, I definitely do want to get married!”&#160; To which my dad reiterated that neither of them needed to worry about getting married right now.&#160;&#160;&#160;

EEEK!&#160; I can just tell this girl is going to give me trouble.
