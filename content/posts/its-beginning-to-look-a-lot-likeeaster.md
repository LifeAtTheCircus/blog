Those that have followed me in the past, know I love holidays.&#160; Here at the circus we celebrate any time we get a chance.&#160; Who doesn’t love some themed treats and fun crafts?&#160; 

But two holidays hold special significance for us.&#160; 

Christmas and Easter

They are not just days to get dressed up and partake of traditions. 

And to set them a part we spend a great deal of time, as in weeks, preparing for them.&#160; They are more than a day, but rather a season of celebration.

So, when I heard about this carnival going on over at [Becoming Me](http://becomingmethruhim.blogspot.com/2009/03/wondrous-cross-easter-frills-and.html), I was eager to link up.&#160; She’s hosting a carnival where people can link up with their Easter traditions and stories. 

We have a few Easter traditions here.&#160; In addition to inviting both sets of grandparents over the Saturday before Easter to join us in dyeing eggs and going for an egg hunt, our biggest tradition is spending the weeks prior to Easter focusing the significance of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross, for our sins.

 Easter is about a month away.&#160; I am looking forward to this time of reflection, confession, and worship.&#160;&#160; What does your family do to celebrate Easter?
