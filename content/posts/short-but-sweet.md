Our time at Biscayne National Park was fun[![IMG_5410](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_5410.jpg "IMG_5410")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_5410.jpg), but way too short.&#160; We took a 3 hour tour (which thankfully turned out much better than the infamous 3 hr tour).&#160;&#160; I think the kids favorite part was the 45 minute ride out to Boca Chita Island.&#160;&#160; They described their ride out their as “the best rollar coaster ride ever!”&#160; The wind was really blowing.&#160; I thought it felt much like those [super sonic hand dryers](http://www.prodryers.com/servlet/the-1/Hand-Dryer-GreenSpec-LEED/Detail) that look like they are ripping your skin off.

I love our lil man’s expression… you can see it was VERY WINDY up there!

So, we made due with the time we had exploring and frolicking on the island before heading back to the main land.&#160; On our way back we were able to watch the Blue Angels practice for an air show that weekend.&#160; It was a lil taste of home![![IMG_5457](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_5457.jpg "IMG_5457")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_5457.jpg)
