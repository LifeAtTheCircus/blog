Despite the fact that I lack a [green thumb](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/03/31/my-not-so-green-thumb/) and [raise suicidal plants](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/01/the-answer-my-friend-is-blowing-in-the-wind/), I still attempted a garden this summer with my kids.  Some may call me a hopeless optimist, to others I am just naive.  But, my oldest two children were particularly excited about this new venture and I didn't want to let them down.

This April we planted a row of peas, a row of green beans, a row of pumpkins, two tomato plants, and two pepper plants.   

 At first we had several pea plants sprout up.  I didn't know you had to stake them though, so they eventually withered away.  I had two green bean plants pop up, and I got a whopping total of 2 green beans (and a whole lot of weeds).   

 Later we had pumpkin plants pop up and even produce nice yellow blooms.  I really held them out as the promised plant, the ones destined to bring forth great produce.  I imagined the golden pumpkins sitting on my stoop all in a row this fall. 

They failed to germinate and the blooms eventually withered leaving me with green leaves and dead blooms.

We've had about 7 or 8 tomatoes so far this summer.  Today we went to check to see if we had any more red ones and we had the mother load waiting for us!  Check out our tomato harvest!!  And we have at least as many more on the vine waiting to turn red! 

While we didn't exactly raise enough to live off of the land this fall, at least our grand experiment wasn't a dismal failure.  We got something pretty for our efforts, and it might be just enough to motivate us to try this again next year.
