Most people think that perfect beach weather is a bright sunny day, but we discovered unexpected joy in a trip to the Florida beach on an overcast evening following an afternoon rain storm.

[Shuttle launch](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2011/07/09/we-finally-have-blast-off/) in the morning, nap in the afternoon, beach in the evening, and [free Chick-Fil-A](http://www.cowappreciationday.com/) right before bed… it was a perfect day in Florida… totally worth the 32 hours of driving it took to get there and back.
