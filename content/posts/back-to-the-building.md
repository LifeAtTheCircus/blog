And so a new year begins… this morning was our first day back at the tutorial.&#160; I can’t believe it marks our 6th year of homeschooling.&#160; What a blessing this community had been to our family.&#160; 

Here we are starting 2nd, 3rd, and 5th grades!

_“And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the glory and praise of God.”&#160; Philippians 1:9-11_
