You may or may not have noticed that lately, I haven’t been blogging much.&#160; 

I can’t put my finger on why exactly. 

&#160; [![IMG_2510](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_2510.jpg "IMG_2510")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_2510.jpg) 

It’s not his fault… he is super easy going.&#160; 

And it isn’t due to lack of fodder… the circus crew provides me with a never ending supply of bloggable material.&#160; But, my days have been “more full” lately.&#160; Our schedule includes&#160; home school, tutorial, gymnastics, soccer, (and cub scouts starting soon).&#160;&#160;&#160; I’m also struggling to get back on top of the laundry and maintain the house… got a schedule for that too.&#160; (if I could just get caught up again so I can work on maintaing it)

It seems when the day is done, I haven’t the mental capacity for more than a status update on face book.&#160;&#160; 

So, here’s my past week via face book to fill in the gaps here on my blog.&#160; 

##### put my youngest to bed tonight wearing the &quot;hand me down&quot; shin guards and holding the pink Adidas cleats that were given to her by another soccer mom at her sister's practice today.

##### &#160;

**I realized after posting that status update that I misspoke, she is no longer my youngest, but rather my youngest girl**

##### USED to love going to the library.... Now I wonder, is it really worth it?

&#160;

##### is tired and unmotivated

&#160;

##### Just made my daughter a new sweater (I accidentally put my 100% wool sweater in the dryer)

&#160;

##### my son was just yelling back and forth with my next door neighbor about tonight's game, I reminded him to be respectful and he said, &quot;Mom, we were just trash talking.&quot;

&#160;

##### is taking the kiddos for donuts this morning as I promised them we could go to celebrate the new Sunday School year...nothing like sending them off to meet their new teachers all loaded up with carbs and sugar!

&#160;

##### is too tired to do anything... we had one FULL day... 2 early morning soccer games, kids first lemonade stand, party, target trip, then home for dinner, baths, bedtime...leaving the mess for Monday, Momma is ready for bed!

&#160;

##### is excited and inspired after my first sewing class!

&#160;

##### is frying up some white perch for dinner[![IMG_2988](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_2988.jpg "IMG_2988")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_2988.jpg)
