Spring break was FABULOUS!&#160; Oh my, what a treat to have an entire 6 days off of school.&#160; It was like a foretaste of summer vacation, (which for this homeschooling family is just around the corner).&#160; But before we get back to the books tomorrow, thought I’d share a few of our favorite memories from the week.&#160;

Our oldest son finally got to enjoy his Christmas gift by attending opening day with Dad (and saw his first Orioles win)

It was a wonderfully relaxing and fun filled week.&#160; Now to buckle down, put our nose to the grindstone and finish the school year strong.
