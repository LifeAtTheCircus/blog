My husband and I were talking in the kitchen when my son popped in and dropped a bomb on us.  We appreciate his upfront honesty but we were caught totally off guard.  

We're trying hard to take deal with this rationally, but what parents wouldn't be devastated.  

It's just that he showed so much promise.  His is so smart.  We try not to get carried away with his potential but we couldn't help but to dream about where his future could go.  

It seems he's made his choice.  He didn't even show remorse.  

He proudly walked into the kitchen and announced []()- "Mommy, I'm a pot head".

We're a strong family... we'll get through this.
