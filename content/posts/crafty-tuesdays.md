Crafty, I am not.  But, I was an elementary education major, so I do know how to use scissors and glue.   And, I have found that I really enjoy doing simple arts and crafts projects with my children.  

But, the circus life can get rather busy.  And as with most things, if I am not intentional, the opportunities and the moments pass me by.  

So, this year I have designated Tuesday as "Crafty Tuesday."

I have found that having one day a week set aside for crafts allows me a week to plan ahead and get everything together.  I picked Tuesday because it is the one day a week we don't have a morning commitment.  We typically have a leisurely start to the day, take care of errands mid day and after nap time we work on our "special projects."    

I try to make dinner something easy on this night, either a crock pot meal, something I prepped earlier in the day, or something which requires minimal effort.  This way we can work on our projects without worrying about stopping early for dinner.

This last one was a two parter as we took a nature walk last week to gather our  materials and this week we glued them down to make letters spelling "Give Thanks," which we then hung on the wall behind our dinner table.

Crafty Tuesday works for me, as it provides me with a way to enjoy some quality time with my children each week.  Check out [Rocks in My Dryer](http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/) for more great _[Works for me Wednesday](http://lifeatthecircus.com/category/works-for-me-wednesday/)_ advice.
