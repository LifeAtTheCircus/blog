What gathering would be complete without a light saber battle?

I loved getting to watch my nephew and nieces play and to observe my brother playing with my children.&#160; There is something quite special, and indescribable about watching your children play with your sibling.&#160; It truly warmed my heart. It was a blessed evening indeed and one I am truly grateful for.&#160;&#160;

Thanks guys!&#160; I look forward to doing it again!
