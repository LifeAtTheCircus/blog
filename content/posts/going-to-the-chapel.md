I went to a wedding the other night. 

The bride looked dashing in her floor length ball gown, with her shoulder length hair worn down.&#160; The groom was handsome in his navy blue jacket with a red and gray tie, and a simple black eyed susan taped to his jacket lapel.&#160;&#160; The bride carried matching black eyes susan’s picked fresh from her mother’s yard.&#160;&#160; [![princess wedding](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_0932.jpg "princess wedding")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_0932.jpg)&#160;

As the ceremony began the bride’s cell phone rang.&#160; Her groom was most disturbed b/c, “brides don’t carry cell phones to weddings.”&#160; This bride was hearing none of that and took the call.&#160; She wanted to ask her mom over for casserole that night following the nuptials and had been waiting for her to call her back.&#160; After the phone call the groom planted a big wet one on his bride b/c, “they always kiss, dance, and eat cake in weddings… oh and the rings.”&#160; The bride was not so keen on the kiss, but did enjoy the dancing turned wwf wrestling on the 
living room&#160;&#160; 
ball room floor afterwards.&#160;
