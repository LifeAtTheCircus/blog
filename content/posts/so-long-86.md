While he wore the jersey for 14 years, she proudly wore hers for 3.&#160; (more than half of her life).&#160; It was her first jersey and I always thought it suited her personality well.&#160; [![IMG_8676](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_8676.jpg "IMG_8676")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_8676.jpg)&#160; 

As we listened live to Hines bid his tearful goodbye to football this afternoon, we were sad to see him go but as my 7 year old pointed out, “thankful he’s not going to play for the Ravens.”&#160; [![IMG_6950](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_6950.jpg "IMG_6950")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_6950.jpg)

As he retires, his jersey, it seems time to retire hers as well.&#160; As she pointed out after the announcement, _“I’m going to need a new shirt so I have a new guy to cheer for and it has to be a Steelers guy because I won’t cheer for a Raven.”_

From our part of Steelers nation where we proudly wear our black and gold in a land of purple, thank you, Hines Ward.&#160; Thank you for all you brought to the game.&#160; Thank you for your leadership both on and off the field.&#160; Thank you for giving us something to cheer for, for so many years.&#160; We’ll miss you and look forward to the day we can wave our towels for you again at your induction into the Hall of Fame in Canton.&#160; ![DSC_8662](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSC_8662.jpg "DSC_8662")
