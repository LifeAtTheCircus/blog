 I’ve been to a few parades in my day.&#160; Unlike the kids, I’m not all that surprised by what I see.&#160; I’ve come to expect the fire trucks, army tanks, corvettes, marching bands…

This year however, there were a few things I hadn’t seen before.&#160;

Gotta love keeping it green with the organic fertilizer.&#160; Not your typical parade entry.

I’m all for safety, really I am, but if that missile accidentally goes off, how much good will that fire extinguisher do?
