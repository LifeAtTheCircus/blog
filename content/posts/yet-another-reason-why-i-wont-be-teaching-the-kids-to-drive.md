I seriously stink at parking.&#160; (Not parallel parking.&#160; I’ve got a secret for that.&#160; I never do it.&#160; Ever.&#160; Yes, I will walk twice as far when parking downtown to avoid parallel parking on the street).&#160;&#160; 

But, my struggle is with the ol’ pull in parking lots.&#160; More specifically, backing out of said spots.&#160; I’ve been known to wait around in my car for the car beside me or in front of me to leave so I can get out of my spot b/c I parked too close to the line and can’t get out without damaging one of our cars.&#160; And I’ve gone back into the house of a friend to get someone to come help me back out when I leave a party or gathering before most of the people and I don’t know how I’ll squeeze out the driveway. 

And no these events didn’t take place back when I first got my license… they’ve taken place during my married life… even my married with kids life. 

But tonight was a new low.

I walked home from soccer practice.&#160; (with the keys to my husbands car in my hand).&#160; 

It was supposed to be so easy.&#160; Scott met the kids and I at practice.&#160; When practice was over, I suggested he take the kids home in the van so I could stop by to grab something for dinner on the way back to the house. 

But when I went to his parking spot I found a bit of a tight squeeze.&#160; Big old truck parked right by the line of my parking spot on my left.&#160; Wooden posts on my right.&#160; And a minivan behind me. 

I slowly inched back…turned the wheel. 

Nope to close to that truck, I’m going to hit it. 

Pull back in… this time trying to stay close to the right side.&#160; Try again.&#160; Looks like I’ll make it.&#160; But nope, too close to the van.&#160; Can’t do it.&#160; 

Pull in again.&#160; Try calling Scott. 

No answer.

Try again.

No answer.

Back out again…. going good… slowly, slowly, turn the wheel….no I can’t.

And so, I walk home.&#160; (Luckily it isn’t a far walk at all, it’s just too far for 3&#160; slightly distractible and all too often painfully slow kids to walk there quickly and have any hope of making it to practice on time).&#160; 

I get home and tell Scott that his car is still at the elementary school and ummm we gotta go back and get it. 

So, at 7:15, we put the kids back in the car (even though we haven’t eaten dinner yet) and drive back to the school (why Mommy?)&#160; to get the van.

Scott doesn’t say a word.&#160; Not one word.&#160; Till we get to the car (in the now vacant lot), when as I hop out he says, 

‘This time I’ll wait for you.”
