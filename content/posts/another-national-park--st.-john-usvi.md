When we found out the itinerary for the family cruise, Scott and I were super excited to see that the ship would be stopping at St Thomas… this meant that we could take an excursion to St John and visit US Virgin Island National Park!!!  

That’s right, another vacation with a sign pic for the circus crew!!

National parks rarely disappoint and St. John was no exception.  St John was our family’s favorite day of the vacation (and there were a lot of good days)!

We even saw an iguana on St Thomas right when we got off the cruise ship…. you know your day is off to a great start, when you’re greeted by an iguana!

The kids enjoyed it all, from the ferry ride over, to the van ride to the park.

The snorkeling there was fun and amazing… even better than we had even hoped.

We saw so many beautiful fish and even an eel and a sting ray!  All 6 of us got to enjoy snorkeling.

 I was so thankful for all the swim practice the kids had earlier this summer, because not once was I worried about them swimming out there.  

This brain coral impressed me!

And the “electric blue” looking fish was one of my favs.

The eel, is the leopard colored like thing you see hiding in the coral.

We got to try our hand at stand up paddle boarding, which has been something on my wish list for a while now.  The water was so clear.  When I jumped off the paddle board I thought I could touch b/c I could see the bottom so clearly, but quickly discovered I was in water way over my head.

Pop even did a little kayaking.

Every single time my youngest saw a fish he would point and say “fish” through is snorkel.  It was really cute and there were a LOT of fish so it happened a lot.  In addition to snorkeling, our youngest had a fantastic time playing in the sand with his cousins.

His favorite aspect of the day was “spending the whole day together with everyone.”

It was such a fun day with many precious memories.  I’d definitely go back and spend more time at St John if I had the opportunity.
