Well, I am about one month into my homeschooling experience and thought I’d reflect on it.

I love it!

You know I waffled and prayed and struggled with the decision.&#160; It wasn’t like I knew from the minute I brought him home from the hospital that I’d be a home schooling mom.&#160; As I prepped our “classroom” I was still clinging to the fact that at any moment I could change my mind and enroll him at the local public school.&#160; And when anyone asked what we were doing for school this year I would always answer, “we’re home schooling for kindergarten.”&#160; Taking it one year at a time.

But, here I am already eagerly looking forward to future years of schooling my children.&#160; But, I’m still going to take things one day at a time.&#160; 

My favorites parts?

* saying the pledge with the kids each morning.&#160; I love, love watching them put their hands over their hearts, hold the flag, and saying the pledge.&#160; Actually I love our whole “opening time” together… the pledge, singing The Grand Ol Flag, our memory verse and catechism questions… I love that we’re all doing it together

* the look on my son’s face when things click… just today I sat down and wrote some three letter words for him to read.&#160; I’ve been suspicious for a few weeks now that he was ready to read, but for some reason I didn’t move to the next level.&#160; Today he read his first word “cat” and his first sentence “The cat sat on a mat.”&#160;&#160; He then called his dad and left a message on his voicemail saying, “Dad, I can read!”&#160; Def a highlight mom moment for me. 

* I love being on a schedule.&#160; (not a fan of waking up at 6), but love starting our day at a set time.&#160; Starting early capitalizes on my children’s _morning people_ personalities and leaves us with plenty of time for playing, cleaning, and other things I need to fit into our day.&#160; I’ve known for awhile that waking up early would change the atmosphere in my home, but couldn’t make myself do it without the accountability of school.

*I love that I am making time to read, and teach, paint, and run outside with the kids.&#160; Sure we did those things in the past, but now that I am more intentional, we do it on a much more regular basis.&#160; I feel like I am a better mom to all the kids because I am homeschooling my son.&#160; And my girls are learning more this year than my son learned last year in preschool.&#160; 

*I love the tutorial he’s attending.&#160; I feel like it really gives our family the “best of both worlds.”&#160;&#160; We’re still adjusting and adapting to the new social situation, but already all 4 of us have formed new friendships.&#160; 

Low points?

* Handwriting.&#160; That definitely seems to be our struggle.&#160;&#160; It’s obviously something I should have been working on earlier.&#160; He’s getting it, but it’s not easy.&#160; We’re both working hard on diligence and patience and perseverance. 

*One thing I’ve noticed in my month of home schooling, is that there are a gazillion options out there for home schoolers.&#160; Museums, karate, plays,&#160; ice skating, swimming… every company and their brother wants to offer you a discount to take advantage of those families that are home during the school day.&#160; And for home schooling parents who are worried about things like “socialization” and fitting in those PE and&#160; art hours, it’s tempting.&#160; If your not careful, you can easily book up each and every day with activities and find you spend very little time at home.&#160;&#160; I’ve found I gotta be disciplined and intentional with the opportunities I take advantage of and those which I let pass. 

But, over all, I am so glad we chose to home school this year.&#160; I am pleased with the tutorial we’re using and loving the quality time its affording me with each of my kids.&#160; I am thankful for the experiences I had in a traditional classroom as a third grade teacher, because I feel it more than adequately prepared me for my role as a home schooler.&#160; And I gotta say, teaching my children is by far the most rewarding job I’ve ever had.
