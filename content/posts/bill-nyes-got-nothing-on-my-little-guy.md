The kids have been into “experimenting” these days.&#160; We even have science journals with which to record our results.&#160; (Yes, we can thank Sid the Science Kid for that brilliant idea).

It started with freezing stuff.

I overheard my son tell his sister with a hushed voice of excitement, “Sis, you watch…we’ll put this cup of water into the freezer and then later when we come back it will be ice.”&#160; 

Ah, the thrill…

From cups of water, they then moved to other random objects, slippers, plastic toys, juice boxes…

Here they are “investigating” their frozen juice box.&#160; Do you see those eager faces of anticipation as they removed it from the freezer?&#160; 

Later I opened the freezer to find this.

Seems the poor little people girl was frozen into a cup of ice.&#160; They loved watching her melt out on the deck later that afternoon.&#160; 

He also tried sticking ice cubes into a cup of water and then freezing it.&#160; We liked how the ice looked different in the cup this time.&#160; 

On Monday, my son asked me to write some instructions onto sheets of paper.&#160; He wanted me to write in all capitals, very small, “like a printer” in the center of the paper. 

One sheet read, “make experiments”

Another read, “use a crane to make something”

Still another said, “make fire.”

And my favorite, “make experiments with fire.”

When Daddy got home he said that these were their directions for experiments they needed to do together. 

So Daddy seized the day and came up with a fire experiment for him to do with the kids.&#160; They took 3 different colored papers.&#160; Then Daddy burned each one and they had to watch the flame to see if it looked different for each paper.&#160; They made predictions, talked about the results, and recorded their findings by drawing pictures in their science journal.&#160;

For simple, fun boredom busters that can involve the whole family, might I suggest a little science?&#160;&#160; It’s been a hit here at the circus!
