Well, I am really sad to say our trip is winding down.&#160; We visited the last National Park of our vacation and we can count the number of days left on our trip on one hand.&#160; 

The last park on this grand vacation was Badlands National Park in South Dakota.&#160; [![IMG_4442](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4442.jpg "IMG_4442")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4442.jpg)

We hit the Badlands on a great day and a great time of day.&#160; The sun was low in the sky making the colors pop out.&#160;

The temperature was also quite pleasant for climbing and hiking around in the hills (a.k.a buttes).&#160;

We had a nice picnic dinner and afterwards we told the kids they could once again climb on the “playground”.&#160; I turned around to see my 5 year old leading the pack half way to the top!

My 7 year old isn’t one bit afraid of stepping out on the overlooks either.

It was fun to walk around in the midst of the Badlands.&#160; The mounds (“buttes”) look and feel up close like your walking on plaster of paris.&#160;&#160; While we were hiking the kids spotted some wild mountain goats ahead.

They kept their eyes on us and we kept our eyes on them and our distance from them.&#160;&#160;&#160; We also saw a wild rabbit hop right in front of us on a walk way to an overlook.&#160;&#160; It’s so fun to see these wild animals in their natural habitat.&#160;

We finished our hike just in time to barely catch the sun dip behind the clouds on the horizon. [![IMG_4663](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4663.jpg "IMG_4663")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4663.jpg)

Then we set off to try and find a camp site for our last night of camping this trip.&#160; 

It’s a little sad to have finished our last National Park of this trip.&#160; It really has been so amazing to have this time together as a family and enjoying God’s creation.&#160; I love the beauty and the uniqueness of His creation.&#160; I also enjoy seeing how vastly different the various regions of our country are.&#160; It’s been fun to experience different climates and cultures and even accents.
