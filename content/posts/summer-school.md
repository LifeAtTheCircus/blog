Just because it is summer, doesn’t mean we have to stop learning here at the circus.&#160; God presented us with a wonderful science lesson, right in our back yard.&#160; The best part is, I don’t even have to do any prep work for the lessons![![IMG_0606](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0606.jpg "IMG_0606")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0606.jpg)

 A very brave and trusting Momma Robin built a nest under our deck.&#160; Apparently, she doesn’t require peace and tranquility to feel safe as our crew stomps back and forth across our deck belting out songs or squeals or tantrums from morning till night.&#160; 

Because of the location she chose to build her nest it is pretty much impossible to see inside. 

Though my brilliant husband&#160; is not easily thwarted by Momma Robins.&#160;

I still wanted a glimpse of the actual eggs.&#160; Scott found a mirror and was able to snap a picture of the eggs using the mirror.&#160;

This afternoon as we were watching the bird cam I noticed some movement in the nest.&#160; I was fairly certain the eggs had hatched and when Scott got home he was able to prove my suspicion correct!&#160; If you look closely at the bottom bird you can actually see his beak!&#160; I can’t believe how tiny they are!

This poor Momma bird comes and goes all day long bringing food back for her baby birds…I thought I had it bad nursing all day and night, but at least I don’t have to go hunt it down!&#160;
