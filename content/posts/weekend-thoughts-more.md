I've sung along to these lyrics dozens of times as I drove along in my minivan.  But when I was running last week and this song came through my headphones, they hit me unlike any other time.  God loves me, Crystal, more than the sun and the stars.   As I listened to the words, I just imagined my Creator singing them to me and I was overwhelmed that **He** would chose to love _me_, wretched sinner that I am.  I encourage you to read these lyrics, and listen to the words and imagine your Creator singing them just to you.  He loves you that much, you know and more.

Take a look at the mountain   
Stretching a mile high   
Take a look at the ocean   
Far as your eye can see   
And think of Me   
Take a look at the desert   
Do you feel like a grain of sand?   
I am with you wherever   
Where you go is where I am   
And I’m always thinking of you   
Take a look around you   
I’m spelling it out one by one   
Chorus:   
I love you more than the sun   
And the stars that I taught how to shine   
You are Mine and you shine for Me too   
I love you yesterday and today   
And tomorrow I’ll say it again and again   
I love you more 

Just a face in the city   
Just a tear on a crowded street   
But you are one in a million   
And you belong to Me   
And I want you to know   
I’m not letting go   
Even when you come undone 

Chorus

**BRIDGE**:   
Shine for Me   
Shine for Me   
Shine on, shine on   
Shine for Me   
I love you more than the sun   
And the stars that I taught how to shine   
You are Mine and you shine for Me too   
I love you yesterday and today   
And tomorrow I’ll say it again and again   
I love you more

 




 

One more thing that got me was this line, "I love you more than the sun and the stars that I taught how to shine You are Mine and you shine for Me too"  

God created the stars to shine, and he created me for that purpose too.  My purpose for being is to glorify God, that is why He made me.  Am I fulfilling that purpose each day?  

This is what I am pondering this week.  I hope you too will be moved by the love of our Father and will take time to contemplate wether you are living your life each and every day in a way that shines for Him and brings Him glory.

_My posts typically relate funny anecdotes about the happenings here at the circus. While my days are seldom “normal” enough to leave me without a “post worthy” moment, I use my last post of the week to highlight something a little more “thoughtful” and significant. If you had a thoughtful post from this last week, or choose to make a new one, please feel free to add a link in the comments section below. I’d love to hear what you are thinking._
