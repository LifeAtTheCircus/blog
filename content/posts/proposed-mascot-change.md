Tonight the kids and I were enjoying a walk at the Naval Academy when we spotted a statue of their mascot, the goat, which prompted a rather comical discussion. 

We talked about how the goats are the navy mascot, to which my 3 yr old responded, “But mom, goats aren’t scary.”&#160;&#160; I then said that the Army is afraid of them b/c when they play each other in sports (not war) then they are against each other and don’t want to lose to them.&#160; We then discussed the Army donkeys and how they are afraid of the Navy goats to which my three year old again responded, “But mom, donkeys aren’t scary.”

My 6 yr old then said, “Now, skunks would be scary.&#160; If I saw a skunk I’d be real scared and need lots of tomato juice!”

“Yes,” my four year old responded, “and snakes… Snakes are scary too!”

There you have it folks, the circus family has spoken.&#160;&#160; To the high ranking officials at West Point and the Naval Academy.&#160; The circus family proposes you change your mascots from the goat and donkey to something a little more frightening… 

snakes and skunks

Looking forward to the next [Army/Navy gathering](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/06/go-navy-beat-army/) in December.&#160; Should be really interesting!
