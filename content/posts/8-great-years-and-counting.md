I put together a short video for our anniversary (I promise it’s only 2 min 10 secs) of my hubby and me over the past 8 years.&#160; Those of you who have read [our story](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/02/13/the-college-years/), see if you can tell why I picked [the song](http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Love-Grows-Love-lyrics-Caedmon%27s-Call/20B7B999D6A47FFA4825734200252E5B) I did.&#160; Also, for fun see if you can pick out the 3 shots taken by my son in this 2 minute video montage.&#160; 
  









  

As I look back over the past 8 years I see lots of national parks and newborn babies…what a great time we’ve had!!&#160; 

Here’s to many more years of new and exciting things with you by my side Scott!!
