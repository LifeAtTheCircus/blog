One Sunday I picked my 2 year old son up from Sunday School and found goldfish in his bin.  He had saved some of his snack to share with Mommy and Daddy.  My jaw hit the floor.  His thoughtfulness both touched and humbled me.  

Our church has a fellowship time between services in which you can have some cookies, popcorn, coffee, and lemonade.  Once my son was old enough to attend church with us after Sunday School, he got to come join us for the fellowship time as well.  Each week for the past two years he’ll grab three cookies from the table.  The first time I stopped him, telling him he only needed one.  Turns out the other two were for his sisters.  And every single week, he grabs 3 cookies so he can eat one with his sisters in the car on the way home.  

He does things like this often.  Last week in Kindergarten his teacher gave them each a bag of Swedish Fish.  Knowing these are Daddy’s favorite candy, my son did not each his candy at school with the rest of the class.  Nor did he tear into it when he got into the van at the end of the day.  Instead he saved it until Daddy got home and then gave each person in the family a fish.  

While I sneak cookies to enjoy in secret during nap time or after bed, he will save his to share with the family later.  

I am so glad that my girls are watching him so closely.
