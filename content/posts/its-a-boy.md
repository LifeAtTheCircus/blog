This week we welcomed a new member to our family.&#160; [![IMG_8653](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_8653.jpg "IMG_8653")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_8653.jpg) 

Our sweet baby boy was born this week… 

weighing in at 8 lbs 14 oz and measuring 20” long.&#160; [![IMG_8685](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_8685.jpg "IMG_8685")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_8685.jpg) 

It was love at first sight for all of us.&#160; We really can’t get enough of him, so it seems.&#160; [![IMG_8737](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_8737.jpg "IMG_8737")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_8737.jpg) I can’t wait to fill you in on the labor story and share the pictures from his fist visit with his big brother and sisters.&#160; Nor can I wait to share all the gazillions of photos we’ve been snapping as we strive to bottle up and savor each precious moment this past week.&#160;&#160; [![IMG_8815](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_8815.jpg "IMG_8815")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_8815.jpg)

I will leave you with these snapshots of his first few hours.&#160; Check back often this week as we’ll have many more pictures and details to share.&#160;&#160;&#160; For now, please join us in celebrating his healthy and safe arrival into our family.
