journal
 blog on some of the big life happenings round here these past few weeks.&#160; Last, but certainly, not least, would be the girls Mini Olympics performances at gymnastics.&#160;&#160; I LOVE Mini-Olympic time.&#160; It’s the one time of year when we get to go on the other side of the glass wall and watch our girls up close.&#160; And since I am often entertaining a toddler or taxing around an 8 yr old or running errands, during their practice time, I truly cherish getting the opportunity to watch them perform.&#160; (and yes, I would be _that_ mom with the camera and video camera out trying to chronicle it all)&#160; (but I assure, you I’m not the only one!)

She is now moving up to the Sea Otters class which means she gets to practice twice a week for 2 hours a session, just like her big sister did last year.&#160; She is quite excited about this!

Next up would be our now 6 year old.&#160;&#160; The thing that impresses me most about her is her hard work and determination.&#160; She has never, NOT ONCE, ever complained about class… not the sit ups, not the pull ups, nothing.&#160; She goes in and she works diligently and loves it.&#160; She&#160; is moving up to the level 4 team this summer.&#160; She is really excited about this b/c it means she gets to do gymnastics for more hours.&#160;

I love watching both of my girls practice.&#160; I am so proud of how hard they have both worked this year and all that they have learned.&#160; After a little time off, we are gearing up for a new year of gymnastics with a new&#160; “taxi schedule” for mom.&#160; But, the smiles on their faces are worth every mile in the minivan and minute in the waiting room!
