 Our two year old as gotten quite attached to her baby doll.  She mothers her in all sorts of ways.

She reads her stories at nap time.

And arranges a spot for her (and almost every one of her stuffed animals) to sleep beside her at nap time.

She gives her a nebulizer treatment because she had a bad cough.

She even started potty training her this week!

  I must say I am enjoying watching her in this stage.
