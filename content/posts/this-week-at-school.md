I feel like we are off to a pretty good start this school year and we are settling into a routine. 

The hardest part for me about home schooling and the part I like the LEAST is the juggling act of wearing both the hat of mom and the hat of teacher.&#160; The kids don’t understand that my making them do a subject they don’t like doesn’t make me a mean mom, it makes me their teacher.&#160; That is a struggle.&#160; I am just hoping and praying that these struggles will produce character… godly character in all of us.&#160; 

I think my favorite part of homeschooling is the actual&#160; mom part… getting to be with my kids more and them getting to be with each other.&#160; As I write this my oldest and youngest are playing football in the backyard for recess.&#160; If my 10 year old was away at school they would not have this time together… nor would they have the moments of talking around the lunch table.&#160; These are the moments I cherish… these are the ones I have to hold on tight to when we are crying over wrong math problems and struggling to recall declensions and arguing over who gets to use the computer first.

These moments…

Always, always when they work on jingles or recitations or memorizing, they are upside down… not sure if it helps them sink in better to their brains or not.&#160;

As part of art (something that I am SOOOOO guilty of neglecting) this year I bought some cards which are so so cool.&#160; They have pictures from several paintings at the National Gallery of Art.&#160; Each picture has a set of 2, one that is a close up of the painting and the other has the whole painting and the title and artist.&#160; On Fridays we play Old Maid, or Go Fish, or matching using these cards and it is helping us get face time with these famous paintings.&#160; Then I plan to use these cards on a field trip later this year where we will go on a scavenger hunt to find them.&#160; This has been fun.

His favorite subjects are history, literature and writing.&#160; He loves working on his writing projects, especially when he gets to type on his computer.&#160;

Science this year is AWESOME!&#160; There are TONS, TONS of labs to choose from each week.&#160;&#160; I really, really hope I can keep up with this, b/c I think these will prove to be the moments we all savor the most from school this year. 

We made and experienced an amorphous solid this week using cornstarch and water.&#160; (it was so so cool)

And we learned about freezing points and even lowered the freezing point of water by using salt and making frozen apple juice.

This was fun and tasty and something everyone could participate in.

It was good for me to stop and reflect on the good moments at the end of this week, because to be honest, the moments aren’t all good.&#160; It’s messy… messy b/c we are living life while doing school… and messy b/c we are shaping character while doing school.&#160; There is disrespect, and disobedience, and selfishness and fighting, and laziness… there is a short tempered Momma wearing her pjs’s reheating her coffee and desperately yearning for a few moments of peace…
