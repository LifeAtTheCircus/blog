This week I took my girls on a field trip with their classmates from our tutorial.&#160; We visited a Science Center run by the local school system.&#160;&#160; The kids learned how to observe the world around them and record those observations.&#160; They studied bugs and wild life found in our area as well as learned about camouflage and even played a game to reinforce the concept. 

They got to use almost all of their senses.&#160; It was such a nice treat for them to skip book work for a day. 

But, truthfully, my most favorite part happened today.&#160; 

Today I sent them all outside for recess.&#160;&#160;&#160; And the girls decided they were going to be scientists.&#160; They backed their bags with clipboards and paper, got some binoculars and hopped on their bikes to observe the world around them.

When they came in for lunch, I asked them what they founds.&#160; “3 birds, a squirrel, and 2 earthworm habitats.” 

I loved watching them practice in play what they did on their field trip the other day.&#160; I loved that they found science so entertaining they would choose to spend their playtime engaging in it.&#160; And I love that they are scientists.&#160; Check out what they wrote on the driveway in sidewalk chalk.
