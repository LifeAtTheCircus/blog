I was enchanted by my youngest on Saturday as she played with her dolls.   She played quietly and contently for at least an hour.  I could have done so much with that time and yet I couldn’t take my eyes off of her.  She barely noticed my presence as she sat and arranged her dolls, poured their imaginary tea, and made sure everyone got a sip. Then repeated the endearing process over and over.  My son was busy helping his dad and my other daughter was still napping and while there were dirty dishes and piles of laundry and many other things loudly calling my name inside, I shut the door and sat outside and simply watched her play.  OK, and I also snapped a 
few
, fifty, pictures of the event.  But, I was in a word… spell bound.  By both her g”rown upness”and her “cute little girlness” all the same time.  I couldn’t take my eyes off of her.
