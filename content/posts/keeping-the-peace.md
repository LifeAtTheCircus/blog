My kids love to draw and color and cut and create.&#160; And they are always, always, always asking me for paper.&#160; When my 4 year old doodled all over my check book, I knew I had to come up with something better.&#160; 

One day I stared at our empty popcorn tin and an idea hit me.&#160; For some reason the tin seemed perfect for storing crayons.&#160; Wouldn’t it be great, I thought, if we could have a roll of paper on our table like at Macaroni Grill?&#160; When I mentioned it to Scott, he was instantly on board.&#160; 

So, when my grandparents sent us money for Christmas, I knew at once what I wanted to buy the family.&#160; (remember that hilarious Amazon description [I posted](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2011/12/14/ever-wonder-why-its-called-butcher-paper/) back in December?)[![IMG_1104](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_1104.jpg "IMG_1104")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_1104.jpg)

This paper has worked out so so so wonderfully for the circus fam!

I love it.&#160; We don’t use it every day… I think the novelty of it is what helps it work.&#160; But, it is perfect to pull out on those days when we’ve just kinda reached that point where we’re all going a little crazy, we’ve done all that needs to be done and now I am just trying to survive till Dad gets home.&#160; You know _that_ time of day?

I love that all 4 of them can enjoy it.&#160; With the paper covering the whole table, the little man can color without coloring the table.&#160; I love that they can draw bigger than an 8x11 sheet of paper.&#160; It’s thick enough that we can use it on both sides.&#160; Sometimes they’ll do such beautiful pictures that they’ll cut them out to save.&#160;&#160; [![IMG_1143](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_1143.jpg "IMG_1143")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_1143.jpg)

Sometimes after we’ve used both sides, they’ll just cut… Because it’s fun to cut.&#160; 

If your interested in getting your own, I ended up going with 36 inch wide craft paper b/c it pretty much covered the width of our table… Even after the [fabulous review for butcher paper](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2011/12/14/ever-wonder-why-its-called-butcher-paper/) I read on amazon, I found I didn’t have room for a roll quite that large and so the craft roll better suited our needs. It was skinner than I expected, but we use both sides of the paper so that stretches it some.&#160; I have aspirations of some day attaching it to the underside of the table, back by the wall and then we can just pull it out as needed.&#160; But, for now it stores easily in the rectangular box it came in and sits on the back of our piano.&#160; Craft/Butcher paper on the dining room table [works for me!!](http://wearethatfamily.com/features/works-for-me-wednesday/)
