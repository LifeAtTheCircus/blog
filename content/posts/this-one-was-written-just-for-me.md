The circus crew and I went to run some errands this morning...Target and Michale's were ok... granted we did crack the sugar sprinkle container when the baby threw it on the floor, and my older daughter soon had the spilled sugar all over her face and hands after "sampling it"  but we only got a few looks when the kids were singing jingle bells as they hung off the side of the cart while I finished my shopping. 

Hallmark wasn't even too bad, even though I somehow cut my knee when I bent down to getter a better look at the ornaments, I recall a piece of a broken ornament being on the floor, didn't realize I had knelt on that broken piece, but soon after I felt blood dripping down my leg.

The UPS store, however, was OVER THE TOP.... we had to go potty, we had a fist fight, a temper tantrum, a trip to the van for my cell phone to call my SIL to get her actual address and not her PO Box address... a pause mid conversation to settle another dispute....need I go on??

As we drove home to make lunch and quick get ready for naps, I recalled the Drabble comic I saw in the paper on Dec 7.  I laughed when I saw it then,  

I.TOTALLY.RELATE today.

So, this one's for me.... am I alone on this?
