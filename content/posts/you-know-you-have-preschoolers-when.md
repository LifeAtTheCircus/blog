...you start spelling anything you don't want others to over hear.

Case in point...

Scott and I had parked the car in a crowded parking garage recently, and I knew better than to shout, "Hey Honey did you lock the car?"

So, without even thinking, I said, "Scott, don't forget to L-O-C-K the van!"

But, unlike the preschoolers at home who I am accustomed to spelling around if I don't want them to figure out what I am saying, MOST thieves can spell.
