Get out your 2011 calendars and circle Sept 19th.&#160; It is [International Talk Like a Pirate day.](http://www.talklikeapirate.com/piratehome.html)&#160; I assure you it is one holiday you do not want to miss.&#160; _(If, by chance, you happen to get the date wrong, ahem, and celebrate it on the 20th per say, no worries, your children won’t know the difference and you can still have just as good of a time).&#160;_ 

[We celebrated in 2008](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/09/22/ahoy-there-matey-2/), but sadly missed the holiday last year… something about being in my first trimester and starting my first year of home schooling, caused me to forego the optional holidays last year.&#160; But my kids started asking about it this summer so I was sure to look it up and mark the date (incorrectly) on our calendar.&#160; 

How does one celebrate International Talk Like a Pirate Day, you ask? 

You randomly shout “Shiver me Timbers” and “Walk the Plank” throughout your meal.

…. and say “argh” after most of your sentences.

Make sure you show your teeth when you smile.

&#160;

For dinner serve “Pirate Food”

“What is Pirate Food,” you ask…

Chicken on the bone (aka drum sticks)…

X marks the spot breadsticks…

Pot o Gold (macaroni and cheese), Pirate Teeth (corn nibblets) and don’t forget the Grog (aka “Kid Beer” aka “Root Beer”) and of course dessert…[![IMG_3138](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_3138.jpg "IMG_3138")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_3138.jpg)
