My daughter loves to play school.  She asks me to play All.The.Time.

But, my daughter has never been to school. 

And everything she knows about school, she learned from watching her big brother.

My daughter takes her booster seat down from the table and sets it up in the hall to be her "car seat".  She then has me strap her in and drive her to school.  I then unstrap her and she sits beside me while we wait for her teacher to come to the car and get her.  She grabs her folder and bag, kisses me goodbye and smiles widely as she waves goodbye.  A few minutes later she announces it is time for me to come and pick her up.  I pretend to drive, I wait for her pretend teacher to bring her to the car, she gives me a huge hug, sits back in her seat and tells me about her day.  She shows me her "school papers" in her folder.  She tells me about running around on the playground and what she ate for snack.  And then the routine begins again.  I've played school lots of times over the years, but never quite like this.
