[![Ultimate Blog Party 2009](http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k210/5m4m/buttons/events/ubg3.png "Ultimate Blog Party 2009")](http://www.5minutesformom.com/5654/ultimate-blog-party-2009-instructions)[5 Minutes for Mom] (http://www.5minutesformom.com)is hosting their annual blog party and this year I am joining in the fun!  So kick your shoes off, change in to some comfy pants and make yourself at home, because the best thing about a blog party is you can join in the fun from the comfort of your couch!  

I’ve been blogging for almost a year now.  What started as a fulfillment of my new years resolution, has grown into a means of making new friends and reconnecting with old ones as I share my circus life as a wife and stay at home mom of three active preschoolers.  

Have you ever been to a circus?  Then you know that a circus is a chaotic event with a ton of things fighting for your attention. Your watching a trapeze artist in the center ring when BOOM! A crazy fool shot himself out of a cannon in the ring to your left.  You start watching the clowns in that left-hand ring only to find out that you totally missed another man actually stick his head into the mouth of a lion in the right-hand ring....  

[](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/crystal-70.jpg)My roles as wife, homemaker and [mother of 3](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/10/a-dream-come-true/) feels much like a three ring circus with each ring constantly vying for my attention. Life is often chaotic and many aspects ([like folding laundry](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/13/the-bane-of-my-existence/) ) simply don't get the attention they deserve.  

## [In Ring #1 - My Role as Wife](http://lifeatthecircus.com/category/wife/)


  

I start with my role as wife because aside from [my relationship with our Lord](http://lifeatthecircus.com/ring-leader/) , it is the most important relationship in my life. With three small kids vying for my attention and mounds of laundry and dishes piling up to be taken care of, it's all to easy to take him for granted.  

[![Me and my husband at college graduation (two weeks before being married)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/graduation2-200.jpg)] (https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/graduation2-200.jpg)I am incredibly blessed to be married to my [high school sweetheart](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/30/most-congenial/) and best friend. We dated for 4.5 years before we were married almost 8 years ago (after graduating from college together). I can honestly say that the highlight of my day is when his car pulls into the driveway (and not because it means I will have extra help with the kids). He adds a level of fun and enthusiasm to the house that [brightens all of our lives](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/22/my-mr-incredible/) .  

Each day before [he](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/24/what-a-man/) leaves for work, when we pray as a family, my husband prays that God would enable each of us to bring Him glory in all we do that day. That truly is the goal of our marriage. While we often fail, our gracious Lord is patient and forgiving.
  

## [In Ring #2 - My Calling as a Mother](http://lifeatthecircus.com/category/motherhood/)


  

When I am navigating my way through the grocery store with my 3 kids... the baby sitting in the seat on top of the grocery cart, my toddler in the basket sitting on the bread, and my preschooler standing on the end of the cart pointing out all the things he insists are on "his grocery list", people often look at me and say, "[My, you've got your hands full](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/29/whats-up-doc/) ." Often [I literally do](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/03/i-try-to-give-the-very-best/) . Life with three kids in 3.5 years is [busy to say the least](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/30/a-day-in-the-life/) . Someone always wants me for something, and often everyone wants me at once. BUT, I can honestly say I love every minute of [it](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/17/come-play-with-us/) . I love [my kids](http://lifeatthecircus.com/circus-cast/) ! I love being their [mommy](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/02/lessons-learned-from-motherhood/) . I love staying home full time with them.  

[![image](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/mothering-three-200.jpg)] (https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/mothering-three-200.jpg)

People ask me if I miss teaching (the profession I had before I had my son) and I always respond, "Not a bit!" I am teaching, full time, 3 of the 4 people I love most in this world and there is no place I'd rather be. Sure, it is [loud](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/08/up-up-and-away/) [] (http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/30/the-most-annoying-sound-in-the-world/), and my to do list is always greater than my energy level, but I am often reminded that our children [grow up in the blink of an eye](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/21/i-blinked/) , and I don't want to miss it.
  

## [In Ring #3 - My Profession as a Homemaker](http://lifeatthecircus.com/category/homemaker/)


  

[![Folding Laundary](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/folding-150.jpg)] (https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/folding-150.jpg)No Martha Stewart tricks here. [Laundry is the bane of my existence](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/13/the-bane-of-my-existence/) . We do wear clean clothes, but most of the time we find our days clothes in the laundry basket. It is a rare week where I get the [laundry folded](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/16/hurray-for-the-pack-n-play/) , and put away... we celebrate being washed! I do enjoy cooking though, especially baking (I'd take eating raw cookie dough over folding towels any day). [![Thanksgiving Turkey](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/thanksgiving-100.jpg)] (https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/thanksgiving-100.jpg)I also have a ton of fun throwing birthday parties and making fun birthday cakes. I love holidays and get a kick out of decorating the house, doing crafts, and making themed food to celebrate the occasion. We celebrate St. Patty's Day, Valentine's Day, Flag Day, Cinco de Mayo and I often host big family dinners on Thanksgiving and Christmas. The two most important holidays here are Christmas and Easter and make no mistake, our kids know the [reason](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/14/weekend-thoughts-the-perfect-father/) why those holidays are important.
