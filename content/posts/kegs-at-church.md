Last week my son was reading a list of words in one of his readers.&#160; One of the words was “keg.”&#160; He asked what a keg was.&#160;&#160; I was trying to figure out the best way to describe it and so I said it was like a a big container with a spout that you could get a drink from.&#160; 

_“Oh,”_ he said with a look of recognition.&#160; _“I know what your talking about, like what we get lemonade from at church.”_&#160;&#160; That’s what I get for trying to be vague instead of just going out and saying it was for beer. 

Whoever put the word keg in a kindergartner reader is the one I will hold responsible when my child shows up at church asking for a keg.&#160;
