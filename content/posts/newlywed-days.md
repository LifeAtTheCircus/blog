I was scrolling through pictures, trying to figure out what to post for [THAT Family's](http://www.wearethatfamily.com) weekly carnival, when I came across these photos from my Newlywed Days.  Aren't these just a blast from the past?

Here we are enjoying our first dinner in our apartment... yup that would be frozen pizza and champagne.  We had just flown in from our honeymoon in St Lucia (you can see the unopened wedding presents behind us).   And check out those newly married tans!  My terrific hubby thought ahead and stocked the freezer with pizza and the fridge with some nice bubbly so we'd have dinner waiting for us when we returned.   I remember we opened wedding presents until we found sheets, then we were able to make the bed.  

We didn't even have a table yet.   I believe the next day we set out to buy a card table which we used for 5 months before buying our dining room table.  We had only room for our plates on the table, the drink pitcher always sat at the floor beside us and the food was typically on the counter.  I wish I had time to scan those pics of our first meal on a real table (but I am trying to pack for my [big trip to Texas](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/10/01/mommys-leaving-on-a-jet-plane/) today and I don't have time).    

I also came across this picture.  We were so excited about all of our new gadgets.  Here were are toasting our cappuccino's with our new cappuccino machine.  We used to make cappuccino's all the time with that thing.  Clearly this was before digital cameras as I am sporting my very typical eyes shut pose.

Be sure to come back this weekend.  I'll have two guest posts and my very first give a way!
