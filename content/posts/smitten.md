[![IMG_2924](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_2924.jpg "IMG_2924")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_2924.jpg)This weekend the kids got to meet their newest cousin, “baby Ewi.”&#160; They were all quite excited to finally make his acquaintance.&#160; The girls have been carrying their dolls around for weeks now feeding, rocking, and putting to sleep their very own “baby Ewi’s.”&#160;&#160; 

But my middle child was probably the most smitten, to say the least.&#160; She could quite often be found by his side, smiling at him, tickling him and laughing at every noise he made.&#160; [![IMG_3004](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_3004.jpg "IMG_3004")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_3004.jpg)

The best was when [Aunt Karen](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/) was changing his diaper and the girls were eagerly peering over her shoulder to watch and help hold wipes.&#160; When she opened the diaper my three year old peered inside and exclaimed for all to hear, **“He’s a BOY!”**

Here’s my favorite pic of the kids and their kids together at last.&#160; I think the facial expressions are priceless.[![IMG_2933](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_2933.jpg "IMG_2933")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_2933.jpg)
