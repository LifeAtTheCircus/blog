Scott and I see eye to eye on most things.&#160; When it comes to parenting though, we have one major disagreement...

pajamas

I think they are cute and cuddly and so adorable.

Scott thinks they are impractical and a complete waste of time.&#160; &quot;Why do we need to change them just to sleep,&quot;&#160; He asks.

I have a hard time coming up with a real compelling reason.

&quot;Because they look so cute in them,&quot; is typically my reply.

When Scott has bedtime duty he rarely thinks this is reason enough to go through the hassle of changing three kids out of their clothes and into another set of clothes.&#160; He typically sends them to bed in diapers and the shirt they wore that day.

And I don't complain, because I feel blessed to have a husband who willingly helps with the bedtime routine, who will let me go for a run while he gets the kids ready for bed and puts them to sleep.&#160; 

But come on, don't you agree... they look way cuter in their pjs?
