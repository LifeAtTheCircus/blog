It has been C-O-L-D this past week here in MD.&#160; I heard rumors that parts of the bay and various rivers and inlets were freezing.&#160; So, this afternoon we took the kids out to see for ourselves.&#160; 

At one of the beaches we visited these ice balls had formed in the river.&#160; I had actually seen pictures of them floating earlier this week.&#160; Now the ice balls are frozen in to the ice.

I was impressed with how far out the ice went.&#160; All the way to the end of the pier and far past it was frozen.

See the ice behind the kiddos?

Here we are at another beach.&#160;&#160; It appeared to be frozen all the way across the river.&#160; But, since we didn’t know how deep it was frozen, we only let the kids stand on the ice on the beach.&#160;&#160;&#160; They enjoyed it though.

I don’t recall it ever being so cold for so long here in MD.&#160; It’s been a nice change of pace to have some actual snow and ice on the ground in January.&#160; It’s nice to not just have it feel like winter, but look like winter too.&#160; I’m hoping all this prolonged cold means the ticks, fleas, mosquitos, and stink bugs that have been germinating year round these past few winters will dye off.&#160; At any rate, we’re enjoying the change of scenery round here.
