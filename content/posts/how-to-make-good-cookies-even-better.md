Home made chocolate chip cookies are my favorite!&#160; I am partial to the recipe my mom got years ago.&#160; 

Perhaps you’ve seen the recipe as well.&#160; The story goes someone asked for Mrs. Fields cookie recipe and was told it cost two fifty.&#160; Upon receiving the recipe, she learned it cost two hundred and fifty dollars rather than two dollars and fifty cents.&#160; Outraged, she went on to share this recipe with the world to get back at them for charging so much.&#160; 

I gotta confess until a month ago, I believed this little story.&#160; Thought I was going around with Mrs Fields very own cookie recipe.&#160; I’d see her store at the mall and think, “Why bother paying for the cookies when I could go home and make the exact same ones and even get to eat the dough?”&#160; 

Yes, I am _that_ gullible.

(I was the girl in high school who believed the line that gullible wasn’t in the dictionary too).

Last month I was craving me some cookies and couldn’t find my “secret” recipe anywhere.&#160; I thought I’d check online since you can pretty much find any recipe you want online.&#160; And that is when I read this [nice little anecdote](http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/14794/the_real_recipe_for_mrs_fields_chocolate.html?cat=22) about how that was an urban legend, documented on snopes.com.&#160; 

What a disappointment!

Though I did track down [my most favorite recipe](http://www.cooks.com/rec/doc/0,1910,153167-232194,00.html) and in the process gleaned three tips for making your cookies taste even better.&#160; 

I tried them and the results were amazing.&#160; 

These cookies were already a favorite staple here at the circus and yet when I made this batch, my husband noticed right away and asked what I did differently.&#160; 

*   The first trick is to melt your butter before creaming it together to make your cookie dough.&#160; It changes the consistency of the cookie and gives you a much softer, chewier cookie.
*   The second trick mentioned was to double the amount of vanilla called for in the recipe.&#160; I did this as well, and I noticed a difference in taste.&#160; It seemed to enhance the flavor if you will.
*   The third trick was to add a tablespoon of milk to the dough at the last step when you are stirring it all together.&#160; Again this is to make a softer, chewier cookie.&#160;

I would assume you could adapt these tips to your favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe, or you can try the [not so secret recipe](http://www.snopes.com/business/consumer/cookie.asp) I’ve been enjoying for years!&#160;
