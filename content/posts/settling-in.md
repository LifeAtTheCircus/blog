I can’t believe my little guy is 3 weeks old already.&#160; I feel like he is growing up so fast!&#160; We’re settling into a routine of sorts here at the circus.&#160; We ventured out this week to a friends house for a play date and to gymnastics…even had some friends over a few times.&#160; I was reminded of how good it is to fellowship with friends and to let the kids play with their buddies.&#160;&#160;&#160; It had been a while.&#160; I am so thankful we had our baby in the summer as we have 3 months to play and take it easy and settle into a rhythm and routine before school starts in the fall.&#160; (We do need to do some work over the summer and I plan to hit the books next week with the crew, but it will be at a more relaxed pace than in the school year).&#160; 

I actually can’t believe the 4th of July is around the corner, summer always seems to slide quickly by once the 4th hits.&#160; Our calendar is filling up&#160; already (4 kids has a way of doing that to a calendar).&#160;&#160; August is going to be here in the blink of an eye! 

Here’s a few pictures of our sweet growing babe from last week and this.&#160; They don’t really fit a theme, but this Momma just felt the urge to share some pics of her baby boy!

Last night he seemed to find his hands, he kept waving them out back and forth almost like he was trying to figure out what they were and what they did.&#160; _I love that!_ He’s also getting much stronger with his neck… he holds it up longer now.&#160; Friends have commented on how he looks so much like a boy these days… I fear he is quickly growing out of his newborn status…
