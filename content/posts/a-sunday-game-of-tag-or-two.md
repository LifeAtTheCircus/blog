It seems the blogging world loves to play a good game of tag.&#160; I've received two tags in the past few weeks.&#160; So, for those of you looking for some Sunday reading here is way more than you could possibly want to know about little ol' me!!

[Busy Mamas](http://busymamas.com/) tagged me over a week ago with this Meme...&#160; (Sorry Busy Mamas for taking so long to respond)!

_Think back on the last 15 years of your life. What would you tell someone that you hadn&#8217;t seen or talked to for 15 years? How would you sum up your life? You get 10 bullet points. A list of 10 things to summarize you. At the end of your list, tag 5 more people and send on the love._

1.&#160; 15 years ago I was 14.&#160; I guess that makes me preparing for my freshman year of high school.&#160; Since it was summer time, I was most likely busy preparing for my first year in the [marching band](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/07/we-were-the-cool-ones/).

2.&#160; In December of 1996, my senior year of High School, [I started dating my hubby](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/30/most-congenial/).&#160; I remember coming home from a date with him on Dec 22 and telling my parents that he &quot;liked me&quot; so we were now &quot;going out&quot; as in he was my boyfriend!!&#160; I was so excited!!&#160; (and still am)

3.&#160; In May of 1997 I graduated High School.&#160; In the fall I started at Towson University and Scott started at Grove City College.&#160; That winter my parents moved to western PA (their hometown).&#160; So the summer after my freshmen year of college I went to my new home in western PA and then started at Slippery Rock University (b/c instate tuition moved to PA with my parents).

4.&#160; OK I picked Slippery Rock mainly b/c it was known for its education program (and I was an education major) and it was 7 miles from [Grove City College](http://www.gcc.edu/).&#160; Towson had RUF ([Reformed University Fellowship](http://www.ruf.org/)) and I had made lots of great Christian friends and loved it there.&#160; Slippery Rock was a P-A-R-T-Y school and while I attended a Christian fellowship group there it wasn't the same as RUF and I hated it there.&#160; I pretty much spent every weekend at Grove City (yea to [my future sister in law](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/) who let me sleep with her on her top bunk almost every weekend) so that winter I decided to suck up my pride and transfer AGAIN... in January of 1999 I started at Grove City College.&#160; I had changed my major from elementary education to English/Secondary Education b/c I loved the English classes I took at Towson and Slippery Rock and professors from both places encouraged me to do so. 

BUT, one semester of Brit Lit at Grove City was eye opening to me.&#160; After a lot of praying, thinking, talking... I realized I was much happier working with children and so I changed my major back to elementary education that fall.&#160; 

5.&#160; In May of 2001 I graduated from Grove City College with a degree in Elementary Education and 5 schools on my college transcripts (Towson, Slippery Rock, Community College of Beaver County and the Community College of Allegheny County).&#160; In order to graduate in 4 years I had to take classes at the CC during the summer and take January and May minisession classes AND take 21 credits the fall semester of my senior year.&#160; BUT I DID IT!!!!

6.&#160; And 2 weeks later I married my high school sweetheart Scott.&#160; I can honestly say that my married life with him has been truly charmed.&#160; When asked how we liked married life shortly after we were married, we both responded&#160; &quot;it's even better than I thought it'd be and I thought it would be good&quot;&#160; Ask me now and I'd say it just keeps getting better!&#160; 

7.&#160; I taught third grade for 3 years at a small, private, Christian school.&#160; 

8.&#160; In spring of 2004 I had [my son](http://lifeatthecircus.com/circus-cast/) and became a stay at home mom. 

9.&#160; In winter of 2006 I had [my daughter](http://lifeatthecircus.com/circus-cast/).&#160;&#160; It has been so much fun watching the two of them bond and connect as siblings.&#160; They share a room and while they def have their moments of rivalry, I'd also say they are best friends.&#160; 

10.&#160; In the summer of 2007 I had [my second daughter](http://lifeatthecircus.com/circus-cast/).&#160; She too is a delight and now that she is growing from baby to toddler I am really enjoying getting to know her and see her personality come out!
