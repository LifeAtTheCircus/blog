Here’s my daughter sleeping in her crib at 8 months old.

 Earlier this week when my husband went in to kiss the kids goodnight, he found her at 3 and 1/2 sleeping in the very same position she favored as an infant.&#160; [![IMG_2757](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_2757.jpg "IMG_2757")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_2757.jpg) I would think with age this position would grow more impossible and uncomfortable.
