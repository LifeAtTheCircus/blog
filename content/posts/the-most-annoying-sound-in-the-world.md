Recently my 2 year old daughter has decided that a good way to pass time in the car is to scream really loudly.  It's also a really good way to annoy her older brother.  

Typically we start driving down the road and she starts making some annoyingly loud noise and then 2 second after she starts, my son starts screaming, "Yell A Little Bit Quieter" followed by, "Mom, she's not yelling a little bit quieter," over and over.  Not long after this the baby starts mimicking the noises she hears and, well, it gets quite loud.  Typically, I just tune it out and keep on driving for at least several minutes before asking them all to quiet down.  I can actually go several minutes with this chaotic noise in the background before I realize how loud it is.  

Here is a 30 second clip of this circus act.  Listen and tell me what it reminds you of.  


 
 
 
 
 


It reminded me of the scene in Dumber and Dumber when he asks the hitchhiker if he wants to hear "the most annoying sound in the world."  As I watched this clip I found it is quite similar to a ride in my minivan.  The petty fighting.... (lately my daughter will say to my son "no Mam" when he asks her something which drives him insane because it should be "no Sir" since he is a boy and they fight about it incessantly)  This clip totally brought out a chuckle.  I can't help but think the man sitting in the middle is very much like my poor baby in the backseat silently screaming "Guys, guys, ENOUGH!"  











What do you think?  Does my daughter do a good Jim Carrey impersonation?
