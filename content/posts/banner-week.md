Exciting things are happening round the circus parts this week and it’s only Tuesday!!

Sunday, I ran a half marathon with my FIL.&#160; My [friend](http://bighappyfamily97.blogspot.com/), who had to run a h[![2011-03-06 BandA 1-2 Marathon 1](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2011-03-06-BandA-1-2-Marathon-1.jpg "2011-03-06 BandA 1-2 Marathon 1")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2011-03-06-BandA-1-2-Marathon-1.jpg)alf marathon in order to see me in real life, also ran but she was so stinking fast that I am glad I caught her in line for the potty before the race, b/c there was no seeing her after that.&#160;&#160; Dad and I ran at our own pace and I felt much, much better about this race than my [last race](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/08/30/this-sounded-like-a-good-idea-3-months-ago/).&#160; This time, I felt prepared and when I finished I didn’t feel like I was going to die.&#160; Last time I knew I wasn’t prepared and it felt AWFUL!&#160;&#160; As an added treat a friend of mine surprised me and ran the last 3 miles of the race with me.&#160; She was a true cheerleader and burst of enthusiasm and I was touched that she went to so much effort to surprise and encourage me.&#160;&#160; Joc, you rock! 

Monday, I could barely walk…see above…but I did get a night out with my friend Megh.&#160; We grabbed dinner and went shopping for jeans…in a size I haven’t worn in YEARS!!&#160; That’s right folks, I am happy to share I am now at the size I was before I got pregnant with my son, over 7 years ago!!&#160; Wahoo… I am super psyched about that!&#160; And I truly appreciate the time to catch up with Megh as well as her help in answering such baffling questions as “What is boot cut?”&#160; and “Do I want dark jeans or light?”&#160; These are the things I am clueless about and I always appreciate her insight.&#160; She willingly comes along with me when I need a night out of shopping sans kiddos and I love that we can just pick up where we left off, filling each other in on our lives and chatting about movies and [TV shows](http://www.nbc.com/parenthood/).&#160; We’ve never really been in the same stage of life ever in our friendship, but I truly appreciate how she just sorta rolls with my crazy chaotic life and accepts me for what I am.&#160; 

While out with Megh, I got a text from Scott which read **“Looks like someone has his first loose tooth![Smile](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/wlEmoticon-smile.png)”**&#160; I was so happy for him b/c he’s been waiting for a loose tooth since early Kindergarten.&#160; When I got home a few hours later and went in to peek on all the kids, he was still up and was super excited to show me how it wiggles!&#160; Here’s a picture of his smile before it changes.&#160; [![IMG_9448](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_9448.jpg "IMG_9448")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_9448.jpg)

Races, New Jeans, Great Friends and Loose Teeth… Oh My… the excitement here at the circus is mounting and we haven’t even reached Hump Day yet!&#160; 

How’s your week been?
