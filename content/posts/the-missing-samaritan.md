God Bless Sunday School teachers…especially the teachers of those dear two and three year olds.  How they keep those squiggling, squirming little bodies still on those carpet squares to hear the whole lesson is beyond me.  

Perhaps, it’s occasionally beyond them too.  Seems they don’t always get quite the whole lesson.  

At lunch today I was asking my three year old what she learned about in Sunday School.  I was so excited to get an answer beyond the typical, “God” or “Jesus”.  

Daughter: “We learned about a man who was stuck on the side of the road and he was hurt and dirty.  And the bad men just passed him by and didn’t help him.”  

Mom:“Hmm…that wasn’t very nice was it?  Did anyone help him?”  

Daughter: “No.”  

Mom: “Wait…are you sure?  No one helped him?”  

Daughter: “No one helped him.”  

My husband chimed in to try to draw out the rest of the story, so he asked, "so, is the hurt man still on the side of the road right now?"  

Daughter: "yep"  

Dad: “Oh...why do you think your Sunday school teachers taught you this story today?”  

Daughter: “I don’t know.”  

I think we will alter our bedtime routine this week so we can spend some time focusing on  [Luke 10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:25-37;&amp;version=31;), our sweet little girl seems to have missed a key component of the lesson.
