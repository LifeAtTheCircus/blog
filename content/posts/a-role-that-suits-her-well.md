My kids made an important decision this week.&#160;&#160; After much deliberation, they’ve finally figured out their Halloween costumes for next fall.&#160; And really, not a moment too soon… what with 146 days till Halloween, it’s a good thing we’ve got it settled.&#160; 

My son will be Luke Skywalker (he told me this week that he wished when he was a baby we had name him Luke Skywalker).&#160;&#160; My 3 year old will be Princess Leia.&#160; And Daddy will of course be Darth Vador.&#160;&#160; My youngest child and my costumes are still up for deliberation… R2D2 and C3PO have been proposed.

We did a practice run through on my daughter’s hair this week.&#160; You know, making sure we’ve got it _just so_ in time for October 31st.&#160;&#160; What do you think?&#160; 

As we talked about Princess Leia, I realized it is a role that suits my daughter quite well.&#160; She’s feminine and royalty and even gets rescued from time to time, but she also has some spunk, speaks her mind, and can defend herself quite well.&#160; Yes, that suits my girl, to a “t”.&#160;
