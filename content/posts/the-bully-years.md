I love pictures.&#160;&#160; Iâ€™ll often find myself just staring at the screen saver on our laptop as the pictures scroll by.&#160;&#160; These two blasts from the pasts crack me up every time they pop onto the screen.&#160; They were taken on two totally different occasions, thought it appears my son was approximately the same age in both.&#160; It also appears that his red striped shirt was his bully apparel.&#160; Does he not look like the kid who would steal your lunch on the playground?&#160;
