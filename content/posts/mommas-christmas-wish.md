Ever year it is the same… I beg and plead for just one small Christmas Eve miracle, a picture of my kids in front of the tree.&#160; The last few years as they’ve gotten older, it has actually gotten easier, thanks to a slight guilt trip from Daddy (do this for Mommy please, as your Christmas gift to her).&#160; I thought it might be fun after sharing this years picture to look back on Christmas’s Past.

2008 

(we didn’t attempt a group kid shot that year, but instead opted for individual poses in front of the tree)

(it appears we didn’t try for a kids only shot and just opted for the family shot that year)
