My oldest daughter has been demonstrating her growing independence and her new sense of style these days.&#160;&#160; 

[![IMG_3094](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/img-3094-thumb.jpg "IMG_3094")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/img-3094.jpg)Her new favorite pants are these orange leggings with candy corn on them that she got at Halloween.&#160; I don’t know what made her take such a liking to them this January but she wants to wear them EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.&#160; 

When she wanted to wear them to the park a few weeks ago with her purple sweater, I started to try and persuade her to change.&#160; Then I recalled a comment I had made recently on a [friend’s blog](http://dailydwelling.com/definitely-no-match) about how I just love the outfits preschoolers put together and how great it is to let them just be themselves.&#160; She insisted she wanted to show Nana her “candy pants” and I couldn’t be a hypocrite, so I complied.&#160;&#160; 

&#160;

She’s&#160; also begun to take a liking to layering her shirts. At first I was pretty impressed.&#160; She came out one day with a green long sleeve shirt with a cute orange shirt on top that had green in the print.&#160; It looked really cute and coordinated well and I thought perhaps she was taking after her [Aunt Karen](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/2009/01/oh-dear-pants.html) with the layered look.&#160; 

But, then the layers kept piling on.

We’ve got the long sleeve tee underneath, with her favorite soccer tee shirt on top.&#160; Then we have her pink Steelers jersey followed by the inside out Elmo pajama tee.&#160; To complete the ensemble we have the super hero cape hanging from the back.&#160; 

I am sure that one day she will look at these pics and post them on [Kristen’s Fro’ Me To You carnival](http://www.wearethatfamily.com) asking what her mother was thinking letting her dress like this and then taking pictures of it. 

But, I can’t help it.&#160; I think she looks adorable.&#160; And I love the quirky looks she comes up with.&#160; I know one day this too will pass and so I am enjoying watching her personality shine through and letting her just be herself.&#160;
