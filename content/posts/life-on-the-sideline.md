Life on the sidelines can be rough.&#160; I know, I’ve been there.&#160; Sat the bench for 4 years of high school lacrosse.&#160; But unlike her mother, my little girl sits on the side because she is too young, not because she isn’t good enough.

My daughter is dying to play like her brother.&#160; It is so cute and yet so painful to watch her on the sidelines.&#160; When the coach calls the team to line up at the bench during practice, she is right there with the rest of them.&#160; When he sends them to run laps, she tags behind.&#160; She will sit riveted at the sidelines watching them.&#160; She can’t wait to play soccer and baseball like her brother.&#160; And while I know it is a bit soon to tell, she seems to have some natural athleticism in her.&#160; 

My son wants to [play soccer again](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/09/18/worth-a-thousand-words-and-then-some/) in the fall.&#160; And so does his sister.&#160; Sadly, you have to be 4 to play.&#160; Which means she has one more season on the sideline.

Or does she? I e-mailed the soccer commissioner this afternoon to see if he was planning to have a program for 3 yr olds this season.&#160; Our league hasn’t had one in the past but many leagues in our area do.&#160;&#160; I was just checking because I figured it didn’t hurt to ask.&#160; 

Here was his response:
  > “If **you** wanted to lead the way, I could put you in charge of it.&#160; We would have to setup the parameters of what it is...something like:

> 1) one day a week...set time Fridays or Mondays would be best.
> 
> 2) shirts provided
> 
> …
> 
> 6) We would need some parents lined up as &quot;coaches&quot;, Soccer authority on the field.
> 
> It would be kind of like an organized play date.&#160; About a $20 cost for shirts, insurance and overhead, painting the lines on the field.  

Ha ha… wait a minute… me head up a soccer program?&#160; 

The only thing funnier than that thought is the fact that I didn’t say No right away.

I’ve never even played a soccer game.&#160; My expertise in soccer comes from wearing the proud title of [soccer mom](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/09/07/do-you-notice-the-difference/) last fall when my son ran up and down the field [pretending to be an airplane](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/11/10/fly-away-dear-boy-fly-away/).&#160; 

Am I crazy?&#160; Why am I even thinking about this?

Because I love her.

And, if it means stepping out of my comfort zone a little to let my little girl have a chance to play soccer once a week, well, that may be worth it. 

Am I crazy?&#160; Should I pursue this or run to the hills?&#160; She’s only 3, she can surely wait a year I know.&#160; I just know she’d enjoy it so much and so the e-mails sits in my inbox as I wait to reply.&#160; What do ya think?
