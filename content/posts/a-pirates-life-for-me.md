This weekend, I surprised&#160; Scott and the kids with a high seas adventure in Annapolis.&#160; 

After donning their costumes&#160;

And getting their tattoos

We were ready to board the ship and set sail in search of our treasure

The kids used their loot to purchase [ice cream for dinner](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/06/28/problem-solved/).&#160; 

A good time was had by all.&#160;&#160; Though I fear the pirate life may agree too well with them.&#160; Donâ€™t they look quite fierce?
