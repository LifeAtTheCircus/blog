My son had his first soccer game last weekend.   I couldn't have been a more proud mom on the sideline as I watched him play.  He grinned from ear to ear the entire time he was out there.    By looking at these pictures you'd think he was the star of the game.  (of course in my eyes, he was) Check him out as he blows past the other team and heads for the goal.

Now, if you're a [soccer mom](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/09/07/do-you-notice-the-difference/) you know that at games played by four year olds, you don't get shots like this.  Kids travel in huge packs swarming around the ball like a swarm of bees.  

Pretty priceless pictures, huh?  

Now for those thousand words...  

This was my son's first soccer game.  EVER.  He'd had one practice before this.  So, the concepts of the game were lost on him.  

When the coaches stopped the game due to someone falling down, my son didn't realize that meant they were no longer going for the ball.

You can see the huddle on the ground on the left and on the right you see my son and a few others seizing the opportunity to go after the ball.

Look at him go, he is so excited...as he blows past the other kids and heads down the field.  You can see the adults in the corner looking towards the left because they know what my dear son doesn't.  The game has stopped.  

This is where the pictures go chronologically from the top of the post.  My son kept right on running down the field and to the goal.   Proud as can be.

This is a shot you don't often see...someone dribbling the ball back down the field away from the goal so they can restart the game.  

His grin as he looked over to us on the sidelines was truly priceless.  While some intricacies of the game are lost on him, he knows you are supposed to go after the ball and take it to the goal.  Not too bad for his first game.
