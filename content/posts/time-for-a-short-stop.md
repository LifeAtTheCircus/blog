_Today’s guest blogger is Sarah.&#160; Sarah is one of the few bloggers I read, whom I know in real life.&#160; My freshman year of college at Towson, Sarah lived on the floor above me.&#160; I was in Bible study with her through RUF and we hung out numerous times throughout the year.&#160; When my family moved and I transferred schools, we lost touch.&#160;&#160;&#160; We found each other on face book this past summer and I’ve been hooked on her blog ever since!&#160; She’s a devoted wife and momma to three small boys.&#160; She is also a fantastic cook!&#160; I have loved every.single. recipe of hers that I have tried.&#160; Check her blog out here at [Short Stop](http://grshortstop.blogspot.com/)…you won’t be sorry.&#160; Sarah is also on vacation with her crew this week, so when I approached her about writing a guest post, she offered to let me repost on of her older posts.&#160; So, here’s an oldie but goodie from Sarah for my circus readers!_

[This Boy of Mine](http://grshortstop.blogspot.com/2008/03/this-boy-of-mine.html)

Yesterday was our second trip back to Bible Study.     
My third trip out alone with all three boys.      
I'm happy to report that I got them dressed and out the door in a time that even Dale Earnhardt, Jr. would find impressive. [**And, I even remembered to close the van door on our way into church**](http://grshortstop.blogspot.com/2008/03/and-there-we-went.html).      
First stop: the potty. We quickly stop with Jack each time we enter church. Only this day, he had a _very important_ rock in his hand that he picked up from the parking lot.      
And, he dropped it. Right into the _I'm-all-finished-Mommy_ potty. And, immediately stuck his entire arm in to retrieve it. You know, winter. Long sleeves. Soaked.      
_&quot;No, no, no, no, no, Jack. You don't put your arm in the potty.&quot;_ Startled by my reaction, he dropped it back in.      
Immediate meltdown. Of historical proportions.      
So, 
in a moment of pure motherly insanity
 out of love for this child, and in the spirit of NOT taking him and his soaked right arm into his class screaming, I retrieved his rock, washed it off, and we left our morning bathhouse.      
We walked into his class and Jack shouted,      
**_&quot;Look at my rock everybody. My mommy got it for me from the potty.&quot;_**      
Love, y'all. Love.
