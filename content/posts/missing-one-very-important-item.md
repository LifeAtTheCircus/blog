Last weekend my husband picked my daughter up and noticed she was incredibly wet.  He commented that someone must have put her diaper on wrong  (Since I was the grownup home at last diaper change, the blame obviously fell to me).  I muttered something about those stupid diapers not absorbing properly.

Check out her look of disappointment. (MOM, you let me down)!

My husband called me in to check out what went wrong with the diaper...

It was then that I remembered the two older kids fighting and one screaming bloody murder while I was changing the diaper.  I grabbed the baby and ran to check on the situation.  Guess I neglected to finish... the odd thing is I did go back and button all 12 buttons on her pants, never noticing the fact that the diaper wasn't on.

So, this one wasn't exactly [Wordless](http://www.5minutesformom.com/) but it does verify that, generally speaking, diapers [Work for Me](http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/shannon/2008/05/works-for-me-we.html). Not that it was intentional but if you were contemplating potty training at 9 months - that _didn't_ work work for me.  Truth is my 27 month old daughter is old enough to potty train but we are being lax because its just easier that way.  Slapping a diaper on gives you timing flexibility (just remember to slap the diaper on).
