I couldn’t help but smile when I looked out the window and saw this scene…makes me laugh when looking at it on the computer as well.&#160; Quite a motley crew we have defending the fortress… the leader in his camo’s with his walking stick (or staff as he refers to it), his trusty sidekicks following in their fairy wings, and Uncle Jim covering from behind with the ever elusive fluorescent double barrel shot gun.&#160;
