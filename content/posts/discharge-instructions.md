When our son was 36 hours old we were getting ready to leave the hospital and the nurse came in for official discharge.&#160; Those of you who have had kids know this is the time they give you all those important instructions, “back to sleep”, “umbilical cord care….”&#160; 

Those of you who have had more then one kid know that this speech gets&#160; progressively less interesting with each discharge.&#160; While I am sure the nurse had Scott’s undivided attention the first time we heard the speech, he seemed easily distracted this time around.&#160; The lighting though the window had caught his eye and I could hear he was taking a constant stream of pictures…&#160; click, click, click, click…

I've never been so happy to see him distracted.&#160; I love the way he captured our little boy.
