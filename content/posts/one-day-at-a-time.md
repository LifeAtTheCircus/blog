A few weeks ago I wrote about [our kindergarten dilemma](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/05/15/weekend-thoughts-waiting-on-his-timing/) for next year.  

After months of praying, discussing, putting of decision making, visiting, observing, and more discussing, I found it refreshing to have it out of  my hands.  

[![IMG_8078](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img-8078-thumb.jpg "IMG_8078")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img-8078.jpg) Last week [my son graduated from preschool](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/05/22/pomp-and-circumstance/).  At the class picnic I was bombarded with questions about where he would go to school in the fall.  I was telling one friend about our situation and she responded, “Well, it sounds like one of those things that will obviously be God working.”  

To be honest, I really felt like he’d end up attending our local public school.  

And maybe part of me wanted that to be the answer b/c I was afraid of the other option.  If confronted I wouldn’t have admitted it, but when my husband pointed it out, I realized he was right.  

Homeschooling does scare me a little.  What if I mess up?  What if I fail?  I’m great at setting goals, but often not so good with the follow through.  How will I make time for cleaning, laundry, lesson planning, grocery shopping, the girls, and teaching?   And what will my neighbors think?  We are already that family with all the little kids that goes to church on Sunday morning, now we’ll home school too.   I wasn’t so sure I was ready for the stereotypes and assumptions that come with being a home school mom.  

So last Saturday, when I got the call from the tutorial director telling me they had a spot open up for my son, I was a little surprised.  

I wasn’t quite gearing up for that answer, even though it was what I knew Scott and I felt was right for our family.  

And yet, even though it wasn’t in the way I anticipated, just like my friend said, it was so obvious to me to see God working.  I was prepared to send him to our local elementary school.  I figured if a spot didn’t open by June, we’d register him with the county.  And a spot opened up just 3 weeks after we were put on the waiting list! I have all summer to prepare my son for the new routine, and to prepare my house, to look at curriculum, to make a schedule for our family…and as I think about it more and more, I can’t help but get excited.  

I can’t wait to teach my son to read! I am excited about having circle time with all three kids.  I am eager to do some of the things I’ve been wanting to do with the kids but haven’t stopped to make the time for.  I can’t wait to give it a try.  

And I know that, for next year, this is what God wants our family to do.  I don’t know about first grade yet.  I am not worrying about first grade.  Today, I am preparing for kindergarten.  

##### Matthew 6:34

Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

I gotta tell you, I find great peace in taking it a day at a time.

_How about you? What’s been on your mind this week? Read something in a Bible study that got you thinking?  Heard a song lyric that touched your heart?  Realized something about yourself that maybe you hadn’t thought of before?  Have a great “aha” moment?   Please share.  I’d love to sit and have a heart to heart with you dear friend.  And thanks to this world wide web, I can.  So do tell, either by linking up below or posting a comment.   I’d love to hear your thoughts this weekend._
