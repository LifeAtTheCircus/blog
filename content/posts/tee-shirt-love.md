Scott has been a huge help and support to me this week… taking time off of work so I can rest up (apparently surgery takes more out of you, then you anticipate)… driving the kids to their activities, helping with school, and meals and cleaning up… So, today, I thought I’d show my appreciation and wear my [“My Husband Rocks](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/11/03/give-away-my-husband-rocks/)” tee shirt.&#160; 

My 7 year old looked at my shirt, read it aloud and said, “So, why did you wear that today?”&#160; I told her I just wanted to say thanks to Daddy for all his help this week while I was healing. 

Hmmmm.&#160; she replied, “So, why don’t you have a ‘My Kids Rock’ tee shirt?”
