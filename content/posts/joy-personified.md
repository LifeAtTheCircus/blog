I don’t share the kids names on the blog… but ya wanna know a secret? If our youngest son, had been a girl, her name would have been Joy. And as I reflected on that recently, I couldn’t help but think what a perfect word that is for our little man.

He truly is Joy personified.

Never have I seen a more happy, more contented, more easy going baby. He showers us all with laughs and smiles. He is a true joy.

And he has brought such depths of joy to our family this past year. [His brother and sisters adore him](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/06/06/meeting-the-circus-family/). Truly adore him. And they have from the moment I told them we were having a baby. He was loved and [welcomed into the circus crew from the womb.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/01/07/its-a/)

As far as our planning is concerned, this little man will be our last baby. And knowing that, I have tried very hard to [savor every precious moment](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/04/08/a-letter-to-my-baby/) with this guy. I have never been rushed for him to reach the next milestone or stage. I haven’t minded the nights when he needed [Mommy to snuggle him to sleep on the couch](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2011/01/24/babies-dont-keep/) or the fact that he held onto his middle of the night feeding longer than any of my other kids did.

I have savored his first year. I love how easily he smiles. I love the way he waves his hands in the air and exclaims with glee when I'm getting ready to feed him. I love that he is my snuggle bug, often falling asleep in my arms at gymnastics or practice.&#160; I love the way his eyes light up when he sees his sisters or brother walk in the room. I love the way he crawls to the gate and says, “Da Da” when Scott comes home from work. I love how he claps his hands and yells a loud grunt when he's at one of his siblings games.&#160; He's the best little cheer leader/encourager!

His laugh, which comes so freely, truly warms your heart and one can't help but smile when he calls out to you and flashes one of his smiles.

We're waiting till later this month to celebrate his first birthday, but I can't help but pause this week and reflect on the gift of joy that God has given our family through this precious lil guy.
