Isn't it amazing how something so simple can trigger a memory so deep?  You hear a song from your past and suddenly you can feel all those emotions and feelings you felt so long ago...it's like it just propels you back in time.

Yea... Faith Hill does that to me.

When Scott and I were dating in college, I spent one memorable Thanksgiving at his family's home.  That evening we were sitting around the dining room table playing [Rummikub](http://www.amazon.com/Pressman-Toys-0425-06A-Edition-Rummikub/dp/B00000IZEW) when I remembered that the Faith Hill TV special was on that evening, and I commented on that fact.  His mom then turned the TV on in the kitchen so we could listen to it while playing the game.  I saw that her husband Tim McGraw was on stage with her and commented something to the effect of, "Oh, this is the song she sings with her husband Tim McGraw, I love this song."

I thought they were singing the song, "[It's Your Love](http://www.hit-country-music-lyrics.com/Tim-McGraw-Faith-Hill-Its-Your-Love.html)."  (don't roll your eyes..I know it's a sappy love song, what can I say, I was young, in love, a complete sap... and about to be humiliated....)

As we sat there playing [Rummikub](http://www.amazon.com/Pressman-Toys-0425-06A-Edition-Rummikub/dp/B00000IZEW) I quickly realized, they weren't singing the song I thought they were.   I tried to avert my impending humiliation and say something to the effect of, "Oh, ya know we don't really need to watch this... uh...let's turn it off and just chat..."  But my future mother in law was so sweet and said something to the effect of, "Oh no, we can watch it, no problem." 

I promise the room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.  Suddenly no one was talking and all eyes and ears were on the TV to watch the concert that Crystal, Scott's girlfriend, wanted to watch.  

Yes, let's listen to this song, that she likes so much.  

Here is where I start turning all sorts of shades of red because they aren't singing "It's Your Love", they are singing their other duet, "[LET'S MAKE LOVE](http://www.hit-country-music-lyrics.com/Tim-McGraw-Faith-Hill-Lets-Make-Love.html)" and there I am sitting around the table with my boyfriend, his mom, his dad, and his grandparents listening to the lyrics, 

"Let's make love  
All night long  
Until our strength is gone  
Hold on tight  
Just let go  
I want to feel you in my soul  
Until the sun comes up  
Let's make love"

I am definitely tomato red at this point and am quickly trying to make this very awkward moment just go away...saying something about how they have this other duet they sing which I thought this was, and oops I was wrong... and let's just turn it off... and his dear sweet grandma who is hard of hearing, says, "Turn it up, I can't hear it"  'What are they saying" and it just kept getting louder and louder....

A few years later when Scott and I were picking songs for our reception, my dad so "kindly" suggested, we dance to that Faith Hill song I loved so much.

Yea...I don't think so....
