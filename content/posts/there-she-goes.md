Truthfully, the circus family doesn’t spend much time on bikes.&#160; We do a lot of fun things here, don’t get me wrong, but there are only so many hours in a day, and teaching our kids to ride bikes has not been where we’ve spent ours. 

But, today the sun was shining, the weather was unseasonably warm here in MD _again_, and as the kids played in the backyard while Scott did yard work, our oldest daughter decided that today she wanted to ride her bike without training wheels.&#160; 

And I just had a feeling that she was going to do it.&#160; You know, how sometimes you just know?&#160; 

They set off around 4:15pm.&#160; At 4:20, Scott sent me this text.
  > “Great strategy.&#160; Let’s not ride for 6 mths then go for it.”  

I began to doubt that feeling I had earlier,&#160; But…

at 4:39pm he texted me a picture of her riding off into the distance.
