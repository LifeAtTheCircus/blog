As we finished up dinner tonight a song came on the ipod that made Scott want to dance and he invited me to join him.&#160; So we did a little swing dancing in the living room with the kids watching from the table. 

Then my son got up and grabbed the “point and shoot” we sometimes let him use to take pictures with and took some pictures of us “to put on my wall” he said.

After Mommy and Daddy’s dance was finished the kids wanted in on the action.&#160; So we taught them how to properly “cut in” and they so cutely tapped us on the shoulders to “ask for this dance.”

Who could deny such a request?

Then they suggested we all go put our “dancing clothes on” and so we quickly changed clothes, pushed the toy box out of the way and enjoyed a truly priceless evening of dance.

I couldn’t help but think of these lyrics as I recall our evening of spontaneous fun.&#160; It’s definitely one of those moments I’ll store up in my heart and treasure.

_“And these are the moments,        
I thank God that I'm alive.         
And these are the moments,         
I'll remember all my life.         
I've found all I've Waited for,         
And I could not ask for more._

_…_

_I could not ask for more than this time together,        
I could ask for more than this time with you.         
Every prayer has been answered,         
Every dream I've had's come true.         
Right here in this moment,         
Is right where that I meant to be.         
Here with you, here with me.”_
