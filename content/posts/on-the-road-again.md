Sunday was one of the few days of our trip that we spent entirely in the van.&#160; While we will be in the car for portions of almost every day of our trip, Sunday was&#160; a day when the event for the day was driving.&#160; For over 11 hours.&#160; We left Ft Smith, AR around 9:45AM5am CT, quickly entered into Oklahoma, drove the top portion of Texas, and arrived in Albuquerque, NM a little after 11:00pm MT.

We saw Oklahoma City.

And just outside of it we saw some of the damage caused by the second recent tornado that blew through a few weeks ago.

We saw a LOT of wide, open spaces.&#160;&#160;

In Texas we saw quite a few wind mills.&#160;&#160; The kids commented that there must be a lot of power in this area.

Just west of Amarillo, TX we made a planned stop at Cadillac Ranch for a little lesson in graphiti art.

My two dirt lovers also enjoyed the chance to play in a little Texas dirt.

By far the coolest state sign weâ€™ve come across so far.

Glow sticks make the night time portion of the ride a little more exciting.

One of my favorite portions of the drive was watching the sunset in New Mexico.&#160; The sky is just bigger out here.&#160; You can see for miles and miles with nothing obstructing your view.&#160; The sun was setting in front of us, and to the north we were able to watch a lightning storm.&#160; You could see the lightning go from the clouds all the way to the ground.&#160; It was beautiful.&#160;
