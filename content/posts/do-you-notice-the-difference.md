I crossed yet another mommy milestone this weekend.  

First came the diaper bag....no longer could I leave the house with nothing but my purse, leaving the house suddenly entailed making sure I had diapers wipes, spare clothes, pacifiers, toys, bibs, the kitchen sink.... then came child two and mysteriously the diaper bag actually shrank as I realized I don't' need everything on those lists in the new mommy books....about a year later came the minivan.  With two small children and another on the way, it was time to move up in cargo space.

This weekend marked yet another milestone...as my oldest son went to his very first soccer practice,  I took on a new title.  


**I am a soccer mom!!**


I've got a schedule and I'll be bringing orange slices and snack to one of the games.  We're going shopping for cleats and shin guards this week, so I'll have yet another pair of shoes to keep track of around the house.

You'll find me on the sidelines this fall screaming enthusiastically and of course snapping pictures of every move my little man makes.   And I'll take advantage of the small window of time I have when he'll actually look my way and smile when he hears me screaming loudly for him.
