Mothering takes a lot of hard work and a lot of late nights.  While I only have four years of experience to look back on, I'm pretty sure it is moments like these that I will cherish when I'm old and gray.

5 Minutes for Mom is hosting a Mother's Day Photo Contest asking bloggers to post a picture that defines motherhood; I knew right away that I had to recycle this previous Wordless Wednesday.  It's hard to capture the happiness my children have brought to my life, but this picture comes pretty close.
