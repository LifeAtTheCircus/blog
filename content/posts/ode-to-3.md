I love the age of 3.&#160; I really feel like the personality of your child fully starts to emerge at 3.&#160; And 3 year olds are funny.&#160; I love their sense of humor and logic and cute little mispronounciations.&#160; And they start to pretend.&#160; 3 is really fabulous in my humble opinion and I am most def going to mourn the passage of time when I no longer have a 3 year old in the house.&#160; Maybe even more than the lack of an infant.&#160; After all 3 year olds sleep through the night and use the potty.&#160; ![Smile](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wlEmoticon-smile.png)&#160;

This week my 3 year old said to me 
  > “Mom you have black hair and I have yellow hair.&#160; So you are a monkey and I am not.” 
> 
> “What?&#160; Why am I monkey?” 
> 
> “Because you have black hair.&#160; I have yellow hair so I am not a monkey.”  

I know I wrote this on facebook, but I am recording this one here too.
  > “Hey Mom, ya know what is funny?”
> 
> “What?”
> 
> “See ya later alligator.”
> 
> That is funny.&#160; After while crocodile.
> 
> “No, Mom, No.&#160; That is not what is funny.&#160; What is funny is See you later alligator.”  


Another thing I love about 3 year olds, is their new sense of style and fashion.&#160; When my 3rd child was three I posted about her [NUMEROUS outfit changes in one day.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/02/25/how-many-outfits-can-one-girl-wear/)



&#160; Well, her brother also likes to change his look, but instead of changing clothes, he simply adds a layer.&#160; It is a rare day around here when you find him wearing simply one shirt.&#160; He likes to pile them on top.&#160; Especially when he wears Steelers jerseys (which is pretty much for at least some portion of EVERY day of his life).&#160; Why wear one jersey when you can wear three?&#160; I’ll put him down for nap or bed and it NEVER fails, when he wakes up I find a different shirt on top of what he was wearing when he went to bed.&#160; Yesterday I posted on facebook:



6- the number of shirts my 3 year old is wearing



3- the number of Steelers jerseys he is wearing




When I drove him to his siblings practices, I could barely squeeze him into his car seat b/c he was
 

so thick.&#160; He looked like either a munchkin or a fully padded football player.&#160;&#160; But, when I got home from going out with a friend last night, he came out to say goodnight and I noticed he added YET ONE MORE shirt to his layered look.

He kept on all 7 layers until the next day when I suggested we take them off before heading to the dentist.&#160; 

He makes me laugh and smile every single day and I am truly enjoying getting to know his unique personality.&#160;
