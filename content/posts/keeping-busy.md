People often ask me what the girls do while I am doing homeschooling with my oldest child.

On Tuesday the answer was “take all the cushions off the couch and every single blanket and pillow they owned and build a fort”[![IMG_0572](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0572.jpg "IMG_0572")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0572.jpg)
