I am quickly approaching a new age bracket.&#160; 

The thirty somethings.&#160; 

It hit me rather squarely in the face yesterday when I looked into a women’s Bible study at a nearby church.&#160; 

I got so excited when I found a [Beth Moore](http://www.lifewaystores.com/lwstore/product.asp?isbn=005162885) study meeting at a church less than 5 minutes from my house.&#160; I quickly e-mailed an acquaintance from that church before even reading the small print.&#160; 

The study I mentioned to her was for 18-30 year old women, she replied.&#160; “Do you fit in that category?”&#160;&#160; She sent me a link for the “30 and up group” which meets the next night of the week.&#160; 

“Wow” I thought to myself.&#160; I could fit in either group.&#160; Since my birthday is this summer, I could join the 30 and up or the 30 and under.&#160; 

And since this is a new church to me, I don’t have friends in either category that could help sway my decision.&#160; 

I am in a rare position where I get to chose where to place myself.&#160; And I have to ask, “Do I want to be the oldest in the crowd or the youngest?”&#160; 

Both nights of the week work equally well for my family.&#160; I get to base my decision solely on where I want to position myself in the age bracket.&#160; 

I am leaning towards joining the 30 and up crowd because I assume more of them will be “motherly” like myself.&#160;&#160; I see a world more of difference between myself and an 18 year old then myself and a 40 year old. 

How did that happen?&#160; When did I start identifying more easily with the middle age group than the young adults?&#160; 

I still have some time to decide, so I wanna know…which group would you join if you were in my place?&#160;
