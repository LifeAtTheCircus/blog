Well, January came and went and I exercised one day in 2009.&#160; This is why I have to [set goals for myself](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/22/my-need-for-goals/).&#160; Without a race in my future, I lack the discipline to get off my butt. 

So, I’ve set my sights on a Half Marathon in May in one of my favorite cities…Pittsburgh.&#160; I am really excited.&#160; I checked out the route online and it looks great…we cross two bridges, run downtown a bit, run along the river overlooking the city and my highlight, we run by Heinz Field (home of the [Superbowl Champs](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/02/02/we-got-our-6-pack/))!&#160; 

I went [here](http://www.halhigdon.com/halfmarathon/novice.htm) and found a training routine.&#160; It’s the same one I used last summer to prep for the [Annapolis 10 Mile](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/25/we-did-it/).&#160; Although last summer I pretty much skipped the cross training, stretching, and strength training days and just ran 3 days a week.&#160; I did ok, but I’d really like to try to follow the schedule this time and see if I can improve my race.

Monday was day one and it called for strength and stretch.&#160; So, I got out a DVD and did some yoga and ballet.&#160; This of course looked like a ton of fun to the kiddos, so they joined me.&#160; It was the most fun I have had stretching, ever!

Hmm, it appears none of us are keeping up with the video, myself included.&#160;

This week I tackled day one of my new training schedule.&#160; From past experience day one is the hardest in that you have to get out of the rut and get started again.&#160; I hope to stick with the plan and run the half marathon this May in a faster time than I did it [last October](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/10/14/that-much-anticipated-weekend-review/).&#160;&#160; To see what others are tackling this week, check out [5 Minutes for Mom](http://www.5minutesformom.com).
