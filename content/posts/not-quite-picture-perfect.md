A few weeks ago we celebrated our youngest child’s second birthday.&#160; Naturally on an occasion as significant as a birthday,&#160; we had our camera out quite a bit trying to capture every moment of the celebration.&#160; It wasn’t till we looked at the pics later on the computer that&#160; I realized at perhaps some moments would have been better left, not captured!

Since she loves dogs, we did a puppy dog theme for her party.&#160; I made the cake to look like our own pooch, Maggie.

Great idea, till your cutting the cake.. Something kinda sick about this picture, huh?&#160; Kids, don’t look…Daddy’s slicing up Maggie!

Later she was building Legos with her grandfather’s.&#160; I grabbed the camera to capture the beautiful moment.&#160; Of course when I grabbed the camera the moment was over.&#160; 

“Mom, what are you doing?”&#160; “I need some help here!!”&#160;&#160;

Seems I was inadvertently snapping a picture of her peeing her pants….poor thing, didn’t make it to the potty fast enough in all the party excitement and Mommy didn’t realize what was happening b/c she was too busy trying to take pictures!.&#160;

And since this post seems to be all about party bloopers, I felt I just had to share this shot.&#160; Lest there be any doubt how old she is, this face should tell it all.&#160; “No, I will not smile for a picture with my cake!”&#160;
