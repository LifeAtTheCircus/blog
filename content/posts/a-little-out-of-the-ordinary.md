Sometimes it takes very little to turn the ordinary into something memorable.&#160; If your willing to change things up a bit, you can have fun with really, very little effort.

The other day the kids and I baked some cookies for a care package, but we saved some to enjoy with Daddy after dinner.&#160;&#160; While we don’t have dessert everyday, a chocolate chip cookie after dinner is not all that memorable.

The kids had the idea of eating our cookies under the table.&#160; 

This simple action turned the ordinary into extraordinary.

They were delighted to have all 5 of us crammed under the table enjoying our treat.

We started with a girls side and a boy side.

This didn’t last for long as the girls soon enjoyed climbing over the “gate” in the middle to be with the boys.

I love this picture because of my youngest.&#160; You can totally tell she is saying cheese as she shows off her mouth full of chocolate!
