I am all about keeping it real, folks.  And Jessica at [Farm Fresh Iowa](http://farmfreshiowa.blogspot.com/) has a carnival called, [It's Real Life](http://farmfreshiowa.blogspot.com/search/label/It%27s%20Real%20Life) which I totally love because it's all about showing the real you.  This week the assignment is to create a real life video introducing yourself to the blogging world.  

I wish I could tell you that we staged the video because I just thought it would be so funny for you to see my kids fighting with each other while I am videoing.  Yea... there is not acting in this video... it is truly, the real thing.  

For better or for worse.  

If the video leaves you wanting to know more about me, click [here](http://lifeatthecircus.com/about-the-show/) for my about page with many fun details about life at the circus.
