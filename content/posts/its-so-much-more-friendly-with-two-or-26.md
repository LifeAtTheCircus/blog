&quot;It takes a long time to grow an old friend.&quot;

Nothing says labor day weekend to me, then a house bursting at the seams with&#160; friends.&#160;&#160; For the past 8 years, we’ve spent labor day with my group of 6 best friends from high school and our growing families.&#160;&#160;&#160; While we’ve changed locations over the years from rustic accommodations, rental homes, and friends houses, some things have remained constant.&#160; If ya wanna see some pics of how the group has grown and changed through the years, check out [this post](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/27/the-lucky-ones/).&#160; 

As the kids grow, it’s been fun to watch them interact with each other.&#160; It adds an entirely new dimension to the gathering. 

Believe it or not of the 34 pictures I snapped of the gaggle of kiddos (ages 5-1 month), this was the best one as it was the only one in which you could see each of their 14 faces (and the one with the least tears).[![kids 2009](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/kids2009.jpg "kids 2009")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/kids2009.jpg)

This year the kids put together a talent show for the parents (much thanks goes out to Andrea for corralling them for this). [![IMG_2116](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_2116.jpg "IMG_2116")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_2116.jpg)

Check out their moves in their opening number.[![IMG_2118](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_2118.jpg "IMG_2118")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_2118.jpg)

Nothing like poker chips to keep the kids entertained.&#160;&#160;&#160; [![IMG_2094](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_2094.jpg "IMG_2094")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_2094.jpg)

I find it rather poignant that while we are enjoying the comfort and familiarity of our lifelong friendships, our children are simultaneously cultivating their own friendships.&#160;&#160; [![IMG_2220](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_2220.jpg "IMG_2220")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_2220.jpg)
