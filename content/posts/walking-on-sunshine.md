Those of you that follow me on facebook or twitter, or have spent any time round these circus parts, know that I whine quite a bit about laundry.&#160; Recently, however, I made a startling discovery.&#160; Rather than being the [bane of my existence](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/13/the-bane-of-my-existence/) as I once thought, it is in fact, the key to my happiness?

Say wha??

[Last May](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/05/03/a-date-which-will-live-in-circus-infamy/), I set out with a quest to get entirely caught up on my laundry.&#160; Do you recall that flock of pigs, flying over the state of Maryland last spring?&#160; Yup… I did it.&#160; And then, shock of all shocks, I was able to keep up with it, doing a load a day, for a good solid month, before lil man made his appearance into the world and our family.

And even though he is the most easy going, laid back, and sweetest of babes one could ask for, well, it has taken me 7 months to get back to the point where I am totally caught up on laundry AND MAINTAINING my quota of one, sometimes two,&#160; (depending on [how many outfits lil miss](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/02/25/how-many-outfits-can-one-girl-wear/) decides to wear in one day).&#160; 

And the thing that shocked me is when I am keeping up with my laundry, I feel on top of the world.&#160; I feel like I am in control of my house instead of the other way around.&#160; I feel accomplished rather than struggling to survive. 

Melodramatic?&#160; Maybe, but let me tell you, I am loving life this week. 

Amazing how if your clothes are all washed and put away, your house is instantly cleaner b/c you don’t have piles of laundry lurking in your closet, and hall way, behind your bed, and in your laundry room.&#160; 

Amazing how it instantly removes a huge amount of clutter and a HUGE mountain of stress. 

This week has been fabulous.&#160; I am staying on top of laundry and dishes and I feel like my house is some what in order.&#160; I am literally a new woman!&#160; And lovin life!&#160;
