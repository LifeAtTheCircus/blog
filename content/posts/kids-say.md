[Mary](http://notbefore7.blogspot.com/) has created a carnival to help us record those funny and precious things our kids say, so we’ll remember them in years to come.&#160; Some weeks I’ve got nothing…this week, however, my kids gave me a few gems I don’t want to forget.&#160; 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Last week my five year old and I were working on handwriting.&#160; Handwriting is often a battlefield for us.&#160; This particular day I knew he wasn’t giving it his all and I wasn’t seeing his best work.&#160; I told him he needed to do his best and reminded him that his tutor would be looking at it the next time he goes his class.&#160; His response, **
“What?&#160; I thought this was just a scrimmage!”
**

I have a thing for those red hot candies at Valentine’s day.&#160; Seriously, could eat em by the handful for hours.&#160; And I was having a hard time waiting till nap time to sneak them so my kids caught me and thus, I had to share.&#160;&#160; When my son had his first taste of a red hot he described it as 

**tasting “like Michael’s smells at Christmas time!”&#160;&#160;** 
I just loved his description and his simile.&#160;

And don’t forget my post on Friday when my 4 yr old told me [she doesn’t believe there is a baby in my belly.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/02/05/good-thing-ive-got-thick-skin/)&#160;
&#160;

I love my life at the circus and the endless source of smiles and laughs my children give to me.[![image](http://i678.photobucket.com/albums/vv146/homeschoolcreations/tinytalklogofall09copy.jpg)](http://notbefore7.blogspot.com/search/label/Tiny%20Talk)
