Have you ever been singing along to a song in front of your friends when you learn that the lyrics you thought you knew weren’t quite right?

I can remember in high school singing along to Amy Grant’s “[Baby Baby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46QAjaCg5Yc)” and when she says, “_Baby Baby, I’m taken with the notion to love you with the sweetest of devotion_”&#160; I instead belted out “_love you with the&#160; sweetest talk of ocean._”&#160; My friend looked at me and laughed and asked what I just sang.&#160; “_Sweetest talk of ocean_” I replied, “Why?”&#160; It never occurred to me that it didn’t make any sense.&#160; To this day when I hear the song it is hard for me to hear anything but “_Sweetest talk of ocean_”&#160;&#160; 

Another high school lyric gone bad was Better Than Ezra’s “[Good](http://www.sing365.com/music/Lyric.nsf/Good-lyrics-Better-Than-Ezra/C01FC2F6D8AF86FE48256897000CFC22)”&#160; I can remember belting out “_It was good livin’ with you warthog_” in front of some of my youth group friends instead of “_It was good livin’ with you (wahow_).”&#160; I even remember asking why they are singing about living with warthogs.&#160;&#160; This of course was met with much laughing at my expense (as was much of my high school experience, but that is another point for anther time). 

I think it is funny how I would just sing what I thought I heard never even considering how little sense it made or that perhaps I heard incorrectly.&#160; It also troubles me that I would sing in public so often as I do not have a good singing voice.&#160; 

Recently Scott was singing Jingle Bells with the kids and had an epiphany as he sang one of the lines.&#160; He always wondered what a “sopen sleigh” ways, assuming it was a certain type of sleigh used in sleigh riding.&#160; It wasn’t until this January that he realized it was a one horse **open** sleigh.

The last misheard lyric I will share with you is another recent one.&#160; I had given the kids a [Go Fish CD](http://www.gofishguys.com/cms/) for Christmas and as I was jammin to the [Mom song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkc9-SvqfDM) I thought one of the lines was kind of odd.&#160; While praising mothers, the song says, 

_“You’re the boss, the driver, The ultimate survivor&#160;&#160;&#160; A doctor, a cooker&#160; Your man thinks you’re a looker”_ 

Only I heard, &quot;“_your man thinks your a hooker_”

At first I just went with it.&#160; I even repeated the line to Scott to which he just shrugged his shoulders as if to say, “Well I wouldn’t put it exactly that way, but…”

But then I got to thinking,&#160; “I hope my son doesn’t ask me to explain what a hooker is.”&#160;&#160; Which made me take pause and listen again as this was a CD by a Christian band targeted to preschoolers.&#160; Surely they don’t want little kids singing about their moms being hookers. I was so relieved when I listened again a few days later and heard it correctly.&#160; I think I even wrote as my face book status that night “Crystal is laughing at herself”

What about you?&#160; Have any misheard lyrics you’d like to share in the comments below?&#160; They are often good for a giggle or two.&#160; When checking the correct lyrics for one of the mentioned songs I stumbled across a site entirely devoted to [misheard lyrics](http://www.amiright.com/misheard/).&#160; A few had me laughing out loud.&#160; I’d love to hear yours.&#160;
