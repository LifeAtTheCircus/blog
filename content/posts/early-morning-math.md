Math has never been my strong suit (except in 3rd grade, I did awesome with the multiplication tables and was the class champ at around the world, but that was b/c all I had to do was memorize facts and not understand the process)

Anyway, as I was saying… math has never been my gifting… and math at 3 am is certainly not my gifting.&#160; So, I calculated the hours again.

Could it really be true?

7 hrs

Yup, I’ve done the math multiple times.

I fed my little guy at 8:15pm and I went to bed at around 10pm.&#160; He didn’t cry to be fed until a little after 3am.&#160;&#160; 8-12 is 4 hrs and 12-3 is 3 hrs…add them together and you get …

7 hrs

Now I can’t yet bank on this happening every night, but I’ve got a feeling that things are going to get a bit easier around here.
