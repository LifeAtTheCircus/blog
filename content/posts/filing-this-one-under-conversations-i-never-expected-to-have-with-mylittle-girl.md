I was cleaning the bathroom yesterday (I know, miracles never cease, huh?) when my 2 and 1/2 year old daughter came in to use the potty.&#160; “Go ahead,” I told her.&#160;&#160; (Have I mentioned that I LOVE the fact that all 3 kids can use their potty on their own, ah sweet bliss—for [11 more weeks](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/03/16/11-weeks-to-go/)!)&#160; Well I turned from scrubbing the tub to see her standing beside the potty.&#160; 

“I want to go this way!” she says (body standing facing the potty)

“You can’t” I told her and lifted her onto the seat. 

“No” she screams, “I don’t want to go this way, I want to go like this,” she pouts and get down from the potty again turning to face the potty… like her older brother does. 

Now she’s been going potty like a big girl for months and this has never come up.&#160; She also has a big sister and a Mommy at home, so it’s not like she’s never seen anyone sit on the potty before and all she is used to is watching boys stand and aim.&#160; 

But as 2 yr olds often do, she dug her heels in and for whatever odd reason was declaring this her battle ground for the moment.&#160; 

“Honey, you can’t go potty like that.”&#160; I tell her.&#160; “Your a girl and girls don’t pee that way. We can’t.&#160; We don’t have a ***** (not going to type the word b/c I don’t want to end up on those google search engines)&#160;&#160; Mommy and big sister sit on the potty and that’s what you have to do too.”&#160; Again I stick her up on the seat. 

Again she jumps down with a big pouty lip and cries of frustration. 

“Fine, then I am not going potty!”&#160; And out of the bathroom she storms.&#160; 

As is often the case with the battles of a 2 yr old, the storm passed.&#160; I finished scrubbing the tub and got dinner on the table.&#160; She returned to the potty later and since I didn’t see any pee on the floor, I can only assume she chose to sit rather than stand. (thank goodness)

All I could do was laugh.&#160; Ah, the battles we fight…the discussions we have, [the words that come out of our mouths](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/28/dont-cry-over/)… we could have never foreseen them before becoming moms… now, nothing surprises me.&#160;
