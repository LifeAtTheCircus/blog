This morning we said a very tearful goodbye to our beloved Maggie dog.&#160; She’s been a faithful and loving part of our family for 10 years.&#160;&#160; When Scott and I brought her home in March of 2003, she was the center of our little family.&#160; Then she lovingly welcomed, one child after another to the circus fam.&#160; She stood guard under their bassinets and cribs.&#160; She gave them something to look at during tummy time.&#160; She cleaned up the food they threw out of their high chairs.&#160; And she slobbered them with kisses when they pulled, tugged, sat on and squeezed her to death.&#160;&#160; I never, not once, worried about her with the kids, though I often worried about the kids with her because I knew she would patiently take whatever they dished out to her.&#160; [![2) I want a kiss](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2-I-want-a-kiss.jpg "2) I want a kiss")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2-I-want-a-kiss.jpg)

She loved to sit in the sun on the back deck.&#160; She also loved to run in the snow and in the fields at my parents house.&#160; You never had to worry about her running away.&#160;&#160;&#160; At our new house, one of her favorite things to do, was sit in the front yard and watch the kids ride their bikes in the street.&#160; She would contently sit in the yard and watch them go back and forth.&#160;

Thanks Maggie for helping us raise our kids.&#160; Thanks for teaching them to love dogs and not fear them.&#160;&#160; Thanks for not begrudging them of the attention and love we poured out on them.&#160; A more patient, easy going, low maintenance dog could never be found.[![IMG_9170](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_9170.jpg "IMG_9170")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_9170.jpg)

You were absolutely, the best baby/toddler dog on the planet.&#160;&#160; And we will surely miss you.
