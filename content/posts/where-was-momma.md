As I was looking over the pictures we took on Christmas Day in order to [make my collage](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/12/27/christmas-memories/), I commented to Scott that it appears I wasn’t there for Christmas morning as I couldn’t find any shots with me in them.&#160; 

Then I realized I was wrong as I spotted this picture.

Whew…. good thing I was wrong… there is photographic evidence of my existence at Christmas 2009.&#160; :-)

The next day when the family gathered again for our more formal dinner, Scott rectified the situation by snapping this lovely picture of my backside.

Hmmm…perhaps I was better off when there was no photographic evidence of my existence!
