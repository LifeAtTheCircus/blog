My little man loves to look spiffy for church on Sunday.&#160; He’s been asking for&#160; “shiny church shoes” for months now.&#160; But penny loafers are expensive and I hadn’t been able to find any at the consignment shop.&#160;

 We stumbled across the loafers and my son was elated.&#160; He was so excited to wear them to church with his suit coat and matching dark pants.&#160; He wanted a tie as well, but sadly he doesn’t own one in his size.&#160; He settled for the button down with the coat, dark pants and shiny shoes.&#160;&#160;&#160;

He looked rather handsome and dapper if you asked me.&#160;&#160; I think it is so cute that he likes to get so dressed up like this.&#160; I am not sure where he gets it from exactly as his dad doesn’t get this dressed up on Sunday.&#160; This is completely his own thing.&#160; Scott will typically wear a button shirt or polo shirt with khaki's.&#160; But, my son has always been an individual.&#160; I like his look and hope he doesn’t grow out of this phase anytime soon.&#160;
