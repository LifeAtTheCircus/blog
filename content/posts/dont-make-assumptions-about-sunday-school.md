While walking to the car after church on Sunday, my son proudly showed me his Sunday School papers.&#160; 

[![IMG_0906](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_0906.jpg "IMG_0906")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_0906.jpg)&#160;

Upon seeing this picture, I assumed what his lesson was about that morning and decided to play a little game with him.&#160; 

“I bet I can guess who this picture is of,” I say jokingly.&#160; Being confident in who it is, I decide to joke around with him and intentionally say wrong answers such as “Andrew, James, or Paul.”&#160; Of course he giggles and says, “no, no, and no.”

Finally, I finish teasing him and say, “I know… it’s Joseph!”

“No,” he answers.

“What?”&#160; “You didn’t learn about Joseph and his coat of many colors?”

Pause

“Nope.”

“Really?”&#160; “Who is it?”

Turns out the joke was on me.

“Jesus,” he answers me.

Totally thrown off, I look at his take home papers and discover he learned about Dorcas who according to his paper, “loved Jesus very much and served him by helping others.&#160; She did kind things for people in the church.&#160; She made clothes for the poor.” (based on Acts 9:36-42)

Guess that’s what I get for being cocky and presumptuous when checking out his Sunday School art work. 

I love that I never know what to expect when I ask my kids about Sunday School.&#160; While this episode made me laugh, my favorite Sunday School recap is still my daughter and [the poor little man on the side of the road](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/03/29/the-missing-samaritan/).
