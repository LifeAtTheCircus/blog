4 years ago today my sister in law got married.  My son was exactly one month old.  I went dress shopping so I could find something to hide the 50 pounds of baby fat I gained.  Hard to find a dress flattering enough to do that, but somehow I managed to find one that I was happy with.

Until I got to the church.  

I was a new mom and new at the whole nursing thing.  I never thought about the difficulties of nursing with a dress on until we pulled into the church parking lot and I said, "Ok, I'll go feed the baby..."   It was then that I realized a skirt and top would have been a better choice.  

Since I had no other clothes with me and my husband was an usher and thus had to go and get ready, I was in a real bind.  I couldn't leave and go back to the hotel (not enough time)  so I had to find a place to discreetly sit with my dress off and nurse the baby.  Hmmm, how many places like that are there in the world?  The church was not very big and I couldn't find any small classrooms or offices to hide in.  I am sure their were bathrooms and looking back now I should have just sat in a stall on the toilet, but that idea never entered my mind.  Instead we went down to the basement where we found a big multipurpose room, with a kitchen in one corner and what looked like a nursery area in the other.  The only place with walls was the kitchen so my husband pulled a rocking chair in.  My husband had to leave me for his usher duties.  I remember there was a door to the outside that led into the kitchen as well as a door from the big open room in the basement.   Neither locked.   I had to sit on the rocking chair with my dress off and nurse my baby - _EXPOSED_ - in the middle of what felt like an enormous room praying that no one would come into the kitchen.  I was alone.  Being new at the whole nursing thing, it took FOREVER and since I was sitting their half naked, it felt like forever and a half.  I don't recall ever feeling as vulnerable as I did that afternoon.  After about 15 minutes I heard footsteps.  _TERROR_ - "Don't come in!".   Thankfully it was my mom who lovingly stood guard while I finished nursing my son.  

Happy Anniversary Sis!  I am sure that is one anecdote we won't find in your wedding scrapbook!!  (For more stories and pictures that will never see the inside of a scrapbook, check out [We Are THAT Family](http://www.wearethatfamily.com/2008/05/sincerely-fro-me-to-you-miniature.html) )
