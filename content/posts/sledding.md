We’ve been wishing for a snow that would cover the grass blades and last night we got just that… a little over 4 inches of powdery snow fell last night and Daddy took an extended lunch break to go sledding with us and enjoy it while we could.

These two were my dare devils, trying to come up with whatever creative way they could to get the two of them down the hill the fastest.

Her favorite part was eating the snow…. she sat out a few rounds so she could happily stuff her face with the cold wet snow.

Then the dynamic duo decided to add a third to their antics.[![IMG_8580](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QwlXc0uymIU/V4m-FWy19PI/AAAAAAAABDk/2eOGBjhFKXI/IMG_85801.jpg?imgmax=800 "IMG_8580")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GvWj8RmMiUE/V4m-Fct5onI/AAAAAAAABDg/7xZOFArmqr8/s1600-h/IMG_85801%25255B1%25255D.jpg)[![IMG_8573](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zHDRPbiZVAQ/V4m-F92nWCI/AAAAAAAABDs/8IK1Fwi6kkk/IMG_85731.jpg?imgmax=800 "IMG_8573")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FsPs2l6S0qU/V4m-FuhVELI/AAAAAAAABDo/DBKJCWMMjsw/s1600-h/IMG_85731%25255B1%25255D.jpg)  [![IMG_8574](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mKWbDOeeG2U/V4m-GNj01xI/AAAAAAAABD0/CHRQtxltUE0/IMG_85741.jpg?imgmax=800 "IMG_8574")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pI3W1iuWZlM/V4m-GEY_5AI/AAAAAAAABDw/TtgjSO42_F4/s1600-h/IMG_85741%25255B1%25255D.jpg)

I went down a token one time…. preferring instead to watch from the bottom.

We were there for about an hour.  I am so thankful that Scott lives close enough to work that he can come home for an extended lunch in the middle of the day and go sledding with us. (when his work schedule permits)… and so glad today his agenda permitted.

Because everything, EVERY THING is better when Daddy is there.
