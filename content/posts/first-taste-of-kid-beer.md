  My son was so excited about the favor we brought home from [my friend's wedding](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/18/facing-one-of-my-biggest-fears/) a few weeks ago.  They gave out old fashioned root beer in bottles with a home made label.  It was his first soda and he was so excited to drink "kid beer" as he called it.

    I think he liked the idea of it more than the actual taste.  He actually drank most of it the next day when it was flat.  My favorite part was watching his facial expressions as he drank it.
