A few weeks ago I was talking with a friend of mine about the Steelers game.&#160; She had offered her condolences on our loss against Tennessee.&#160; I told her I wasn’t too worried about it because we were going to the play offs.&#160; 

She looked at my kind of incredulously and asked, “Really?”

“Yea,” I said.

“Your going to the playoffs?&#160; That’s crazy.”

I was kinda confused, we were after all the leader of our division, and then it hit me…

“We, the Steelers, I said, not we Scott and Crystal.”

We both got a laugh out of the miscommunication.&#160; 

But this time, I mean it.

We’re going to the AFC Championship Game.

CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?????

SOOOOOOOO COOL!!!!!!!

We, Scott and Crystal are going to watch the Steelers play the Ravens in the AFC Championship Game this Sunday at Heinz Field.&#160; 

I can not even tell you how giddy with excitement we both are.&#160; I’m talking jump up and down screaming in the living room when I won the bid on ebay, excited.

I was talking with someone at MOPS the other night and when she saw my Steelers Super bowl tee, she asked if I was a Steelers fan.&#160; I of course told her I was.

The next day she was at my house for the first time.&#160; When she saw the Steelers flag hanging in front of the house, the Steelers wreath on my front door, and what my friends affectionately call my shrine in our entry way (I have a&#160; table which I sit seasonal knick knacks on and for play offs it has a Steelers blanket as the table cloth with an autographed pic of Harrison, a framed card of Bettis, a Steelers ketchup bottle and a piece of 3 rivers field with a wooden Steelers ball sitting on it) she said, “Wow,your like REALLY Steelers fans!”

You could say that.
