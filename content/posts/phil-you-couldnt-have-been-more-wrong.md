March in Maryland is always fickle.&#160; Short sleeves one day and winter coats the next. 

You always know when the first “jacket less” day arrives, that it is just a tease.&#160; And try as you may to simply embrace and enjoy it, the next day when you have to scramble for your winter coat and hat, it is always a bit disappointing.

Having lived in Maryland for most of my life, I know this and expect it.&#160; I don’t put away the winter clothes till the end of May.&#160; And our drawers bulge for the month of April with both sweatshirts and shorts.

But, this year, this year seems worse somehow.&#160; 

This year I find myself yearning for spring more than ever.&#160;&#160; I am so tired of having to worry about coats and hats on top of shin guards and cleats.&#160;&#160; It is March…. the end of March…. I want flip flops people!!&#160;&#160; And yet today I read this forecast .&#160; “_Light snow is expected to arrive late Saturday night, with snow continuing through early Sunday afternoon. With warm ground temperatures, snow will have a difficult time sticking to the ground. High temperatures Sunday are only expected to reach the mid to upper 30s”&#160;_ 

Yea… so much for flip flops… looks like my girls are going to be wearing winter coats and hats for their first soccer game.&#160; 

Cruel, I tell ya cruel….
