This afternoon after church we took the kids to the county’s Public Safety Expo.&#160; The Police and Fire Departments for the country put on an INCREDIBLE expo.&#160; It was both fun and educational. 

 I think going into it my oldest son was a little like, “big deal we are going to see fire trucks”&#160; while my 3 year old was all “WAHOO We are going to see Fire Trucks”&#160; but everyone was surprised by all we got to see and do.&#160; Yes, even the 9 year old was impressed.

Because, we didn’t _just_ see fire trucks.&#160; We watched firemen cut into a car.&#160; We watched them cut the doors and roof off of a car.&#160; And we watched them put out a REAL fire.&#160;

We saw robots from the bomb/explosive division.&#160; We watched a K9 sniffing demonstration.&#160; We saw the tactical response unit.

And we slapped 5 to Sparky the fire dog.&#160; We even snacked on some popcorn and hot dogs.&#160; We also got to see a Police Helicopter up close and personal.

While we found it both interesting and fun to see all of these things up close, I found myself overwhelmingly grateful the entire time.&#160; I was grateful that these men and women would take the time to talk to my family and explain their jobs to us.&#160; But even more than that I am grateful to live in a community with so many men and women dedicated to providing for our safety.&#160; I am thankful for the wealth of technology and machinery available to them to help them do their jobs.&#160; And I am thankful for the training they receive to do their jobs well.&#160; I am immensely thankful to the many, many men and women who dedicate their lives to serving our community… to protecting and caring for us.&#160; We are so richly, richly blessed.&#160; This afternoon as the kids had fun climbing in trucks and checking out the machinery and even weapons up close, I was blessed with a reminder of how very fortunate we are.
