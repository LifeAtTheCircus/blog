Dear Son,

When you grow up and notice that every time you talk people kinda take a step back from you… its not your fault.

You will have come by these socially awkward close talking tendencies quite naturally.

  









  

Blame your older sisters for your lack of personal space.&#160; Because they can’t seem to talk to you without their face literally centimeters from yours.&#160;

Waking or sleeping, car seat, or bassinet or bouncy seat or swing.&#160; It doesn’t matter.&#160; Your poor little eyes can barely focus as you see their face come into yours as they tell you hello and how much they love you.

I try to protect you.&#160; Honest I do.&#160; “But Mom,”&#160; they tell me, “we’re just saying Hi…”&#160; 

They can’t help themselves.

And I am afraid after years of experiencing life like this, you won’t know any better.&#160; 

And you, dear son, will grow up to be a bit of a close talker.&#160; 

I’m sorry,

Mom
