So long summer 2010….

We’ll forever hold you close in our heart for you were the summer that we welcomed dear sweet, squeezable number 4 to our fold.

We enjoyed your lazy hazy days as we spent time playing in our back yard and splashing in our pool…

We were refreshed and rejuvenated by all of your lazy, hazy days and can now ride into fall with its busy schedule and new routines, while eagerly anticipating the traditions the next seasons has in store for us…apple picking, pumpkin carving, trick or treating, football watching, soccer playing, pie eating…
