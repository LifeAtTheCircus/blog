While most kids were getting quizzed on states and capitals, we'd play a game where he'd say a city and I'd have to name the baseball and or football team from that city.  I loved this game!  As evidenced here, he raised me as a Steelers fan since I was an infant.  When I moved to MD he would tape the games not televised here and mail them to me so my husband and I could watch them mid week.  We try to watch at least a few games together every season and typically talk on the phone at some point during every game.  

It's not all about sports though, I have been truly blessed to have a Dad who cares about his family.  He always made his family a priority and was there for us.   He worked long hours to provide for us. He took time out of his work day to watch my [band competitions](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/07/we-were-the-cool-ones/), come to my lacrosse games (even when I sat the bench for the entire game), and he drove my brother and I to and from  school.    My dad is also a great shopping partner.  He would patiently walk with me from one end of the mall to another as I would shop for clothes or shoes or whatever.  He never complained no matter how long I took.  

I have been blessed to have a Dad who loves the Lord, his wife, and his children and I am grateful for the closeness we've shared my whole life.  Happy Fathers Day Dad!
