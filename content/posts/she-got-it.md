Earlier, I alluded to the fact that my daughter [finally got it](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/04/13/my-smiling-soccer-star/) after [her first game](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/03/28/setting-the-bar/) of soccer.&#160;&#160; As the season has progressed, she has truly gotten it, indeed!

Here she is getting ready to steal the ball from the pack.

Hmmmâ€¦ notice a little blocking going on here?

And she goes in for the score!

She did it!&#160; I love the look on her face after scoring another goal!

 Let me just say that I am loving being a soccer mom!
