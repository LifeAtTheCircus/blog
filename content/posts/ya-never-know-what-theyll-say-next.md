Yesterday my girls had me in stitches with the things they were saying.&#160; I had to go write them down so I wouldn’t forget. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Me:&#160; After you eat we are going to go run some errands      
3 year old:&#160; Erin, whose Erin?       
Me:&#160; no, we are going to go to some stores       
3 year old:&#160; Well, can Erin stay with us while you go to the store?       
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~       
My 3 yr old came running to me crying over a&#160; boo boo. 

I kiss it      

3 yr old:&#160; That didn't help (I inwardly lament the fact that my kiss has lost its magical power when I hear my almost 5 yr old say to her,     
_”Sometimes when daddy kisses my boo boos it doesn't help, even though he is a good kisser.”_ 

_~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~_

The girls always have their “baby Eli’s” with them wherever they go.&#160; Feeding them, snuggling them, they are always at their sides.&#160; So yesterday when they were watching Snow White I thought it odd to see their baby dolls tucked into the doll crib.&#160; I brought them out to them and my oldest daughter said, _“No, we are watching grown up TV right now.&#160; They have to stay in their beds.”_ 

_~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~_

I posted this on face book on Sunday, but wanted to record it here so I’d have a record of it.&#160;&#160; Sunday afternoon I caught my 3 yr old singing on the potty….

_“&quot;We went to church... We worshiped God in church. We ate Chill-ee, we ate chill-ee... God in three persons blessed trinity&quot;_

I just love this age and the cute little things that come out of their mouths.&#160; For more of the funny things that come out of lil ones mouths, be sure to visit [Mary’s blog](http://notbefore7.blogspot.com/) for Tiny Talk Tuesday.
