##### _flag day_

Noun: 

1.&#160; June 14, the anniversary of the adoption of the Stars and Stripes as the official US flag in 1777.

2.&#160; Justification for purchasing those fun patriotic outfits and crafts b/c “It’s not just for the 4th of July you can use them on Flag Day too”.

The kids enjoyed making their own [American Flags out of ribbon](http://familyfun.go.com/crafts/ribbon-door-flag-672013/).&#160; They will serve as a great patriotic decoration in our home through the 4th of July.

Dress up Ice Cream Sandwiches by rolling them in coordinating sprinkles.&#160; Idea taken from [Family Fun](http://familyfun.go.com/4th-of-july/4th-of-july-recipes/4th-of-july-dessert/spangled-sandwich-pops-1015529/) again.&#160; But, I skipped the popsicle sticks and let the kids dip their own.&#160; This was super easy and could be easily adapted to any holiday… hmmm black and gold Sprinkles for Steelers games anyone?

This has got to go down as my favorite flag day celebration yet… flag day with friends is definitely the way to go in my book!&#160;
