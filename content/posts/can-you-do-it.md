I remember very little from my college biology class.&#160; The one thing that sticks in my brain is the genetics unit.&#160; I can remember sitting there running through the calculations and thinking, “If Scott and I were to get married we’d have blue eyed kids.”&#160;&#160; The hopeless romantic, head over heels [in love teen](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/02/10/how-the-circus-began/) that I was, I enjoyed the game of _“wonder if.”_&#160; The other thing from the genetics unit that sticks out is that the ability to touch your tongue to your nose is genetically dictated.&#160; 

Sorry bio professor, that’s all I remember from the entire semester. 

But it brought great amusement to our post dinner conversation tonight.

I asked my kids if they could stick their tongue out and touch their nose.

My daughter’s response?

Hmmm…not exactly what I meant, but definitely what I said.

My son however, was able to do it correctly.

To which his sister responded, “My tongue just needs to grow more.”

These are the high-falutin’ conversations I strike up around the dinner table here at the circus.&#160;&#160; 

   
_(Tell the truth, did you just try to touch your nose with your tongue?&#160; Did it work?)_
