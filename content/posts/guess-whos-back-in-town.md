A year ago today my [SIL](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/) was due to have her first born, my sweet nephew Eli, who the circus children affectionately call “baby Ewi”.&#160;&#160; I can’t believe he turns one next week!!&#160;&#160;&#160; He’s in town this week eagerly awaiting the arrival of [his daddy from Iraq](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/10/29/playing-army/) for his R&amp;R. 

I am so thankful that I have a SIL who is willing to travel, b/c even though they live in El Paso, we’ve gotten to see them 4 times this past year!&#160; (more than that really as one of those times was [an extended 2 month](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/02/15/saying-goodbye/) visit to the area).&#160; 

It is my heart’s desire that my kids will have close friendships with their cousins and many fond memories of playing together growing up.&#160; (with a few humorous photo sessions thrown in there as well)

After capturing such a delightful group shot of the 5 of them, we decided to throw Pop in there too since it was his birthday celebration that we were gathered for… clearly the later photo session didn’t go as well as the former… but it def made for more laughs when looking through the pictures!!
