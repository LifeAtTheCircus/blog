We picked the girls up from practice and brought them to our house for the party. Minutes after walking in the door, they were on the bar downstairs, then the trampoline, then doing their routine in the back yard.&#160; 

In the midst of the all that flipping, they also ate, tie dyed and played a messy game with cones and icing.

Cartwheel once again proved her awesomeness when she made an appearance and then tolerated being passed around from one giggling girl to the next.

Seriously, look at that cat’s face?&#160; That look says it all.&#160; Yet she didn’t flinch once… she let every single girl hold her. 

World’s Best Cat.&#160; right there. 

Since the birthday girl doesn’t care for cake, we opted for an ice cream sundae bar.&#160; Fun and sooo much easier than baking and decorating a cake.

We had a great time, with all of her cousins joining in the fun.&#160; Judging by the smile on her face all evening, I think she enjoyed her special day.&#160; Happy 7th Birthday sweet girl.&#160; You are a ray of sunshine!
