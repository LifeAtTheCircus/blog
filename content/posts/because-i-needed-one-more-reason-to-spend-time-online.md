Even though the Steelers don't play until Sunday afternoon, football season kicked off in our house last night.   We had our  Live Draft for our [Fantasy Football League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(American)) last night.  

The kids were in bed a half hour before their bed time tonight with no story or teeth brushing as we had a 7:45 draft time and were both scurrying to research and formulate our plans right up until it started.  

 Clearly posting every night on my blog and keeping up with the blogs on google reader doesn't give me enough time on the computer each week.   I need _another_ virtual experience in which spending time with my friends consists of typing on a keyboard and reading off of a LCD screen!
