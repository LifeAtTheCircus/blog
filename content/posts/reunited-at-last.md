Just one day over 2 weeks from shipping her off to the doll hospital, Kit arrived on our door step during lunch today.

Her arm has been reattached and they even sent her home in a pretty hospital gown, with new socks, and her hair pulled up in a bow.&#160;

It just so happened that Daddy popped home for lunch today and she eagerly greeting him on the steps to tell him the good news.

She was so happy to have her back, fully healed, and in time for her to come to Kindergarten with her on Monday.&#160;
