I’ve already confessed quite a few of my fashion fashion fo paws for you here on the good ol blog.&#160; Why not add another to the list?&#160; (I’m really just secretly hoping that [Stacy and Clinton](http://tlc.discovery.com/tv/what-not-to-wear/) will come whisk me away and give me a brand new ward robe to enjoy with my post baby body… ah, wouldn’t that be nice)…

But, back to reality…

I am afraid that perhaps I know where [my daughter got her bold fashion sense](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/02/04/shes-got-the-look/) from.

Tonight after baseball practice my husband lovingly said to me, “Honey, I really don’t like those pants.”&#160; “I know,”&#160; I replied, “But, I don’t have a lot of options these days…”&#160; “but honey, you wore them in public.”&#160; “Yea.”&#160; “But they are really, um… loud.”&#160; (here is where visions of 80 year old Crystal walking around with purple hair and a bright orange hat pop into my head)&#160; I laughed it off and told him not to worry, with only a week left in my pregnancy I doubt I’ll wear them again. 

I then said, “Hey, you should take a picture so I can put it on my blog…we can see if people think they are as bad as you say.”&#160; 

To which he said, “No… please don’t put a picture on your blog… really you don’t want people seeing them… they remind me of those jams from the 80s.”

And with that I knew… I had no choice but to post it on the blog. [![IMG_8445](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_8445.jpg "IMG_8445")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_8445.jpg) 

So, tell me, honestly… what do you think?&#160;&#160; I can take it, so don’t feel like you have to be polite.&#160; I know they are bright, but I think they are fun.&#160; I will concede they are a bit tight these days and probably looked better about 4 weeks ago.

You can totally side with my hubby and you won’t hurt my feelings a bit… like I said, I am fairly certain I won’t be wearing them again.&#160;&#160; [![IMG_8446](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_8446.jpg "IMG_8446")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_8446.jpg) 

_By the way, these pants were handed down to me from someone, somewhere over the years and I can’t remember who.&#160; If it was you, please know that I personally am not criticizing the pants… after all, I have worn them of my own choosing, more than once, despite my husband’s objections.&#160;_
