This year in History we are studying American History from the explorers to the war on 1812.&#160; I love history.&#160; It is my favorite part of home schooling.&#160; And I am so grateful that we live within driving distance of so many great historical sites.&#160; 

I really wanted to take the kids to Philadelphia&#160; for a day trip over spring break.&#160;&#160;&#160; Scott graciously rearranged his work schedule so that he could join us.&#160; **(because he is the best ever)….** I love day trips with the family.&#160; It was such a relaxing, low key day.&#160; We left the house a little before 9 am and were home just before 9:30.&#160; We saw all that I wanted us to see and had an enjoyable dinner in historic Philadelphia.

I know I mentioned it this summer, but I gotta say it again.&#160; The Junior Ranger programs that the US National Parks do is just fabulous.&#160; Especially for elementary age kids.&#160; It gives them something to do while waiting in line.&#160; It teaches them a thing or two and keeps them engaged.&#160; I love it.&#160; This year the Historical Parks also added trading cards.&#160;&#160; Anytime a kid sees a park ranger they can ask for a trading card.&#160; The rangers will give them a card after answering a trivia question.&#160;&#160; They made the questions age appropriate… for my 3 year old they would pretty much accept the answer “Philadelphia” to almost any question.&#160; ![Smile](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wlEmoticon-smile.png)&#160; The older ones had to work a little harder for it… but what they didn’t know is they were learning more information in the process.&#160; (sneaky rangers)&#160; My kids LOVED this!

We visited the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, and the US Mint.&#160; It was really interesting to learn the history of our currency and to watch money being made right before our eyes.&#160; (sadly we weren’t allowed to take any pictures inside of the US Mint).&#160; We saw several historical paintings, saw the actual chair George Washington sat in at the Continental Congress and stood in the room where the founding fathers signed both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.&#160; We even ate dinner in the building where our forefathers ate and met years ago.&#160; We learned about Ben Franklin’s printing shop, and watched how the printing press worked.&#160; Then we visited the original Post Office and mailed ourselves an envelope so we could have it hand stamped with Ben Franklin’s post office stamp.

I was more than a little awestruck by the history.&#160; History makes me so reflective and contemplative.&#160; Would I be able to do what they did?&#160; Would I be able to risk my life, my family’s life and our well being for the good of our country?&#160; After watching a movie at the visitor center we asked the kids which side they think they would have sided with.&#160; My 9 year old very wisely answered, “I really don’t know because I haven’t been through what they had been through.”&#160; If I am honest, I don’t know either, but I do know that I am grateful for the wisdom, bravery, and sacrifices made by our founding fathers.&#160;
