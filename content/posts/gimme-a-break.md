In an attempt to make oral reading more fun, I gave my son the option of picking any location in our house to do his reading time.&#160; 

&#160;

He chose my closet. 

Would not have been my first choice, but no worries, to the closet we went… I brought a pillow for me to sit on as the floor isn’t so comfy for this 9 mth pregnant momma.&#160; My son looked at me and said, “Hey, how come you aren’t sharing that pillow with me?”&#160; I informed him his toosh could handle the floor and we then stuck a few pillows in front of us to make it more fort like.&#160;&#160; He was a bit put out by the fact that he didn’t have a pillow to sit on but accepted it none the less.&#160;&#160; [![IMG_8169](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_8169.jpg "IMG_8169")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_8169.jpg)

I am reaching the end of my pregnancy and my body seems to be reminding me of that fact more and more each day.&#160; Bending over, sitting, standing, sleeping, all of it comes with increased discomfort.&#160; I often feel like a ginormous whale as I attempt to heave my belly out of bed or off of the couch.&#160; And I’ll admit it, I am not exactly quick or light on my feet these days.&#160; 

A few days ago, I got out of the shower and heard my cell phone ringing.&#160; I raced (or waddled) to the other side of the house in an attempt to catch whoever was calling.&#160; Of course, they had hung up.&#160; I saw it was my husband so I quickly called him back.&#160; But, he wasn’t at his desk.&#160; I left him a message and told him I was at home, he could call me there.&#160; 

A short while later my son and I were in the closet again for reading.&#160; I made sure to bring the phone with me to the closet so that I didn’t have to race for the phone should it ring. 

Wouldn’t you know my cell phone rang again?&#160; (and _of course_ I didn’t bring my cell phone to the closet with us).&#160; So, I heaved myself up and hauled it across the house to try and catch my hubby on the phone.&#160; 

But, this pregnant momma is not fast enough.&#160;&#160; 

Not 10 seconds later, I then hear the land line ringing in the closet on the other side of the house and off to the races this pregnant momma goes. 

Finally, out of breath, I connect with my husband and with a sigh of frustration ask what in the world he is trying to do to his poor pregnant wife?&#160; I explain the scenario and we both get a good laugh out of it.&#160; 

Truth be told, if it has been anyone else on the phone, I would have just ignored it, but I hate missing out on the opportunity to connect with my hubby, even if for a few quick minutes.&#160;&#160; Ah, the things we do for love…
