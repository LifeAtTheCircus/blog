The last stop on our grand adventure of 2013 was Grandma and Papa’s house.&#160; We arrived in the afternoon on the 4th of July… just in time for a cookout.&#160; The kids greatly enjoyed tractor rides with Papa, playing board games with Grandma and running the trains in the basement.

Then they requested a visit to “The Coolest Playground Ever.”&#160; As we trekked around the US over the past 3 weeks, Scott and I learned from the kids that the playground by which all playgrounds are judged against is the wooden one by Grandma and Papa’s.&#160;&#160;&#160; Even when we went to what I thought was the coolest one ever in Gunnison, Co… I was told, “This has the fastest slides we’ve ever been on, but it’s not as cool as the wooden one by Grandma and Papa’s.”&#160; Therefore, Scott and I requested a visit to see this infamous playground.&#160;

After a visit to the playground, we headed back to the house to cool off, and get ready for a camp fire and sparklers!&#160; We were really able to fit quite a lot into our short visit!&#160; We all had a fun and relaxing afternoon and evening at my parents.

The kids are quite used to the drive to and from my parents house.&#160; It’s 5 hours without stopping and they can do it without even having to get out of the car.&#160; In fact a drive to or from Grandma and Papa’s has actually become a unit of measurement.&#160; Throughout our grand adventure, we would compare each days drive to a trip to Grandma and Papa’s… each days drive was either a “little more than a trip to”&#160; “a little less than a trip to” or on some of our long days it was “like driving to grandma and papa’s getting in the driveway and turning around and driving home.”&#160; Today when we got in the van we were able to say that we had “exactly a drive from Grandma and Papa’s” till we reached our final destination….which will be home.&#160; 

Before we set out on this trip, I assumed by this point we would all be sick of driving and riding and more than ready to be home.&#160; But, I can honestly say we’ve had the time of our life and I am NOT READY for it to be over.&#160;
