My friend and I were riding in the car one day when [the song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfkhL_a54bk) “Creed” by Third Day came on.  I told my friend something to the effect of, “I love this song, it’s like everything I believe.”  

To which she laughed (not exactly the response I was expecting) and said, “Your kidding right?  You know this is the Apostles Creed.”  

No wonder I was so impressed with the statement of faith.  Seems it was not written by the band Third Day or Rich Mullins, but by the early church centuries ago.  

I liked the song not because it was the apostles creed and thus suddenly more holy or special.  I liked it because it succinctly summarized what it was that I believed.  

Every time I hear the song now, I gotta chuckle.  But I wanted to share the words and the song with you this weekend b/c I think it is important for us to think about what is it that we believe.  

What do you personally believe?  Not your parents, not your spouse, not even your church, I want to know if you know where you line up with what you believe.  Do you know?  Have you thought about it?  If not, I encourage you to take some time to do just that.  

And if anyone cares, here’s what I believe.  

**I believe in God, the Father Almighty,  
the Maker of heaven and earth,  
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:**  


**Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,  
born of the virgin Mary,  
suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
was crucified, dead, and buried;**  

**He descended into hell.** 

**The third day He arose again from the dead;**

**He ascended into heaven,  
and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty;  
from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.**  


**I believe in the Holy Ghost;  
the holy catholic church;  
the communion of saints;  
the forgiveness of sins;  
the resurrection of the body;  
and the life everlasting.**
