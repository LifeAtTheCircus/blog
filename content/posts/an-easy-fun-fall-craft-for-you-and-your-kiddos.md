We went in the yard to collect some leaves for leaf rubbings and I got another idea of what to do with the leaves when we were finished with our rubbings.

I then took some strips of clear contact paper and peeled the backing off of the contact paper, leaving it sticky side up on the table.  I had the kids lay their leaves down so that the colored side was on the sticky part and the backs of the leaves were facing up.  They got to stick as many leaves on there as they wanted and put them wherever they wanted.  When they finished they sprinkled some red glitter around on the contact paper.

It made a cute fall decoration for our dining room.  There was little mess, and we all had a great time.  Easy, fun, minimal effort fall crafts work for me.
