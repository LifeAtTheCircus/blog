Since it was the first day of spring this week, I decided it might be time to take down the Valentine’s wreath from my door and switch it for my Easter one.&#160; Today I thought I’d take it a step further and even pull out my spring/Easter/”leave up till I pull out the red/white/blue decorations for summer around Memorial day” decorations…as I did the girls were ooing and aahing over the little eggs, flowers, chicks and lambs…Then my 6 year old daughter saw the bunny my mother in law had given me a few years ago and said, _“Awh look at the bunny and it’s even holding a football.”[![IMG_2775](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2775.jpg "IMG_2775")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2775.jpg)_

Yes, that’s right… a football, not an Easter egg was the first thing to come to her mind when she saw this bunny.&#160; Because at our house, football knows no season…it’s a year round obsession and truly, nothing says Easter like a bunny holding a football.
