complete obsession and undying love
 fondness for all things Chick-Fil-A which they’ve grown up with will help you better appreciate the conversation my son and I had last week after enjoying the free Labor day Chick-Fil-A sandwiches. 
  > Son: “Mom, I love Chick-Fil-A burgers without the pickles.”
> 
> Me: “Really?&#160; More than their nuggets?&#160; 
> 
> Son: Yea, well it’s the same thing as the nuggets except the nuggets don’t have the bun and I like having the bread b/c its easier to hold.”
> 
> Me: “That makes sense, but they aren’t called burgers. Their called chicken sandwiches, because they are not burgers.”
> 
> Son: “Oh.&#160; Then why do they have all the cows everywhere?”

We have a plethora of Chick-Fil-A cows in our home.&#160; Each kid has a small one in their bed, I have the Santa cow up in my kitchen at Christmas time, and we even have a giant one in our toy room.&#160; And for the past 5 years my son thought that was because we loved eating Chick-Fil-A cows.&#160; 



Oops. 



I went on to explain the Chick-Fil-A marketing plan to my five year old.&#160; The cows aren’t there to advertise eating more cows.&#160; Why would cows want to be eaten?&#160; I told him how the cows are there b/c they don’t want us to eat them; they want us to eat chicken instead.&#160; Despite the misunderstanding, Chick-Fil-A is still (and will always remain) our favorite restaurant.
