These days pass quickly as I’ve been warned and I stink at keeping a journal, so lately I’ve been quickly opening up my e-mail and trying to jot down the things the kids do and say that I want to remember and then saving it in my drafts folder.&#160; Here are some recent memories recorded so I don’t forget…

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

son: AWWWWWWWWWWWAAAHHHHHHHH      
Scott: What is wrong?       
son: My guitar.&#160; I was playing the guitar and she pulled my pretend guitar plug.       
Scott to daughter: Why did you pull the pretend guitar plug?       
Daughter: because the song was over.       
Son: Awwwwwwaaaahhhhhh&#160;&#160; It was not over.&#160; I never want to play with you again.

Whenever our youngest gets hurt, she comes up to me and asks for “ice” and then no matter where she hurts, she sticks it on her head.&#160; This night she came up me crying with a scratch on her face and asked for ice.&#160; As normal, she stuck it on the top of her head for a few minutes, stopped crying, said “all done” and handed it back to me.&#160;

I was going over the catechism questions with the kids a few weeks ago and was surprised by how many my daughter has picked up just by listening to me review with her brother.&#160; Though she knows the real answer, she surprised me with her response to the first question. 

Me:&#160; Who made you?

Daughter:&#160; God

pause

Daughter:&#160; Weeeeelllll, and you and Daddy helped

When Daddy was away on a business trip my son was talking to me and said “Mom, you’ve had a bad day.”&#160; I asked him why and he said, “because your best friend who you love to eat dinner with is not here and won’t be home for dinner.”

It’s almost a new S.S. quarter at our church.&#160; I was talking about this with my son, preparing him for the fact that he will have a new teacher soon.&#160; He told me his teacher had told him that.&#160; I asked who it will be.&#160; “Miss Dana, “ he said. I told him I knew her and she was really nice and I thought he would like her.&#160; He responded, “Yea, and I heard she really likes kids.”&#160; This made me laugh out loud.&#160; Pity the class that gets the Sunday School teacher who doesn’t like kids.

[“If You’re Going to Play in Texas”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6r4E514nJg) came on one day and my son asked why his cousin (who lives in Texas) had to have a “fiddle in the band” in order to play.&#160; Every time it comes on my daughter loves to stand up and yell “cottineyejo”

After a week of fighting the stomach bug at our house I found the kids playing with my daughter’s doll, “Emma.”&#160; Emma is sick they informed me and they needed a bowl.&#160; My son told me he is Emma’s daddy and he held her on his lap while my daughter would hold the bowl for her as my son made the gagging sounds.&#160; Then my daughter would rush to the bathroom to rinse out the bowl and bring it back to her.&#160;&#160; (_Yes, it was one of those weeks at our house)._
