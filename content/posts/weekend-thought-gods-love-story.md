This week we took the kids to see a performance at the [Sight and Sound theatre](http://www.sight-sound.com/WebSiteSS/getlanguages.do) in Lancaster, Pa.&#160; If you ever get the opportunity to go (they also have a location in Branson, Mo) I 
highly recommend
 you go.&#160; (thankfully we were able to use a home school discount and take our family for less than the cost of one regularly priced ticket).&#160;&#160; We saw their production of [In the Beginning](http://www.sight-sound.com/WebSiteSS/getshowdetails.do?eventCD=ITB), which was a rendition of the Creation story. 

It made me think of the story of Creation in a whole new light.&#160; As they portrayed God walking with Adam and Eve in the garden, they did an excellent job of portraying the love between our Father and His children.&#160;&#160; I felt like it gave a beautiful picture of what heaven will be like, as we will truly dwell with the Father in a way we can’t even imagine b/c our sin keeps us from that while on earth.&#160; It made me so excited about heaven.&#160; Also as I pondered the garden God created, and all its beauty, I realized how magnificent the new heaven and new earth will be.&#160; Right now I love to spend time in God’s creation.&#160; I enjoy gazing at beautiful sunsets, star studded skies, mountain views, ocean views…but the most beautiful thing on earth, is still existing in a fallen world.&#160; Can you imagine God’s handiwork in the new heaven and new earth free from sin?&#160; That will be truly breathtaking.&#160;&#160; 

Another thing that struck me was the consequence of sin. When Adam and Even disobeyed and were removed from the garden , they no longer dwelled with God.&#160; The Bible talks about them walking together with God in the garden (before the fall).&#160; They experienced an intimacy with God unlike we can imagine b/c right now our sin prevents this.&#160; When they left the garden, they could no longer see or feel His presence with that same intimacy.&#160; The actors did a great job of portraying the pain this caused both God and them.&#160; Yet,&#160; the story didn’t end here.&#160; You see how God still cared for and provided for Adam and Eve, even though they no longer dwelled with him.&#160;&#160; More than that, God later provided His son to take the consequences of the sin which prevents us from dwelling with God.&#160; Because Christ took took that consequence on our behalf, we will one day dwell with the Father, much like Adam and Even did in the garden.&#160; 

I left so excited and humbled.&#160;&#160; So often our focus is here on the temporal.&#160; And because this world is all we know, we tend to think it’s pretty great.&#160; Even in its sinful state.&#160;&#160; We don’t know what heaven will be like.&#160; We know God says it will be wonderful.&#160; But it is hard to wrap our human minds around something we haven’t seen or experienced.&#160; So often, I think we doubt it.&#160; If we’re honest,&#160; I think many Christians wonder “how great will heaven really be?”&#160; “Are we just gonna sit on clouds and sing praise songs for the rest of our life?”&#160; Typically, we’ll say, “I know I won’t be disappointed, but I have a hard time getting excited about heaven.”&#160;&#160; But my friends, I truly believe heaven is going to knock our socks off.&#160; For so many reasons.&#160; We have no idea what it is like to truly dwell with our Creator.&#160; We can’t even fathom that intimacy.&#160;&#160; I can only imagine that, that alone will leave us in awe.&#160; But, yet there’s more.&#160; God created us for His glory.&#160; That is our purpose.&#160; And while it is true that we glorify God when we sing His praises.&#160; That is not the only way we bring Him glory.&#160; We glorify Him when we use the gifts He’s given us, for His glory.&#160; I imagine in heaven, we’ll be glorifying Him by working and serving&#160; together (perfectly)&#160; in His new heaven and new earth.&#160; And that is going to be incredible.&#160; Not to mention the beauty we will experience in the no longer fallen earth.&#160; It’s mind boggling to be sure, but magnificent as well.&#160; And I am confident that we will NOT be disappointed! 

I am thankful or family had the opportunity to see this production.&#160; I am also thankful for the thoughts it provoked and the discussions Scott and I had on our way home.&#160;&#160; I think its valuable to spend time pondering these things.&#160; Too often, we don’t.&#160;
