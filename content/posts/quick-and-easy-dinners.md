Shannon at Rocks in My Dryer has asked us to post 5 ingredients or less recipes this week for [Works for Me Wednesday.](http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/shannon/2008/07/works-for-me-th.html) Some of my favorite quick and easy recipes are crockpot recipes.  The only time I come home to the smell of a home cooked meal is when I cook a crock pot meal.  My favorites are the kind when you dump and pour cans into the crock pot.  I have also found that if you use frozen chicken breasts, they come out incredibly tender.  

These meals are served at least once a month at our house and are great for days when I know we will have a crazy afternoon and I want dinner quickly.  And best yet, it doesn't take much time in the morning to get it ready.  When my son was a new born his fussy time of day was always right before dinner.  He slept really well in the morning, so crock pot meals worked for me b/c I could make dinner during his sleepy time and then when he was fussy, I didn't have to stress about making dinner.
