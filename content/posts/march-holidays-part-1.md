I had high hopes for Feb with plans in the works for Mardi Gras and Leap Year celebrations, but the stomach bug and a business trip and well the busyness of life, put those on the back burner… perhaps another next time…

March is full of celebrations of its own, so no time to mourn the missed holidays of February… We started off with Dr Seuss’ Birthday on March 2.&#160; We had green eggs and 

ham
 
bacon for dinner, and Cat in the Hat treats for dessert.&#160; Simple and fun, perfect for a Friday after a long week.&#160;

Always trying to follow in the steps of his siblings…

We celebrated with taco pie for dinner and toll house pie for dessert.

I can’t wait for St Patrick’s Day tomorrow.&#160; I am so excited that it falls on a Sat this year and Scott can participate in all the fun with us.&#160;
