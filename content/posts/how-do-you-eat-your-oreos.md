They are the only store bought cookie I buy and when I see them on sale I have a really hard time not putting at least one bag in my grocery cart!   I have noticed that there are many ways to eat an Oreo.   I never taught my kids how to eat them, yet each has his and her own preference.  My daughter likes to open them up, lick out the cream, and then discard the rest of the cookie.  She is the only one in our family who eats them this way.   She isn't mimicking anyone when she does this.   My son likes to dip his.   He doesn't care what he dips it in.  Usually it is milk, but last night his cup had juice in it when he was eating his dessert and he happily dipped the Oreo in the juice.  My husband dips his in milk, he doesn't dunk it, just dips it in to get it a bit wet.  I like to dunk mine.  I put the cookie in the milk, hold it down with my spoon until the bubbles start going to the top, then pick it up with the spoon and eat it.. mmm, delicious.  So, tell me, how do you eat your Oreo's?
