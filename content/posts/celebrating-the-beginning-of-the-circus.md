10 years ago we came…spread a blanket out on the sandy shore to watch the sunset.&#160; 

Today we came, with sandwiches and Doritos.&#160; This time there was a picnic table where we had spread our blanket.&#160; And we watched the sunset mirrored in the faces of our three children.

10 years ago it was quiet… we held hands and sat close on the blanket.

Tonight there was sand in our shoes and children squirming….

10 years ago we sat up all&#160; night and talked and dreamed of our future together.

Tonight we held our future in our arms (and my belly).&#160;

1o years ago we spent the day in Washington D.C., then topped it off by watching the sunset at our park.&#160; Scott got down on one knee and [declared his love for me](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/02/14/a-forever-kind-of-love/) before asking me to be his wife.&#160; 

And tonight we celebrated that anniversary with a picnic dinner at sunset.

Thank you Scott for asking me to be your wife 10 years ago today and thanks for making all my dreams come true.&#160; I truly, truly love being married to you!
