 Last Friday while the girls spent the day caring for and practicing to hold [“baby Ewi”](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/10/26/smitten/) my son spent the day dressed in Camoes and gathering his weapons arsenal to play army with uncle Jim.&#160;

Friday the kids made cards for [Great Grandpa’s birthday](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/10/23/weekend-thoughts-a-true-gent/) and cards to welcome [baby Eli](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/10/26/smitten/) to MD.&#160; My son also made a card for Uncle Jim.&#160; He wanted him to read it that first night and then to look at the picture again before he goes off to war next month.&#160;&#160;&#160; I had to take a picture b/c when he asked me to spell it out for him, I thought his message was too sweet not to preserve.

“Let’s have fun today and not be sad about going to war.&#160; I love (heart colored in camouflage) you.”

On the other side, he drew this picture of the two of them playing army.

It’s pretty obvious that my son looks up to and admires his uncle Jim.&#160;&#160; And it’s easy to see why.&#160;
