I thought perhaps he had done the dishes or something.  When I went to the kitchen I couldn't find it.  Every now and then when I thought about it, I would look around trying to figure out what it was.  

The other night I was talking on the phone and doing some dishes when I looked at our window and saw a U.  "Hmm... that's odd, I thought."  As I continued talking,  I kept looking up at the window and then I saw it... my love note.  Do you see it?  

You might be wondering how he did this.  I am embarrassed to confess he wrote it in the dust on my window screen.  Pretty romantic,huh?  I guess it is pretty obvious that I don't dust my window screens all that often..... so often that weeks could pass without me noticing the writing on it.  Now I have an excuse not to dust... it'd be a shame to erase my love note, right?
