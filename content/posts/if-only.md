The kids and I took a nature walk last week.  As we walked along the path, I realized we had necessary elements for some great pictures.  

1.  Happy Kids  

2.  Setting sun  

3.  Fall leaves  

However, we forgot the photographer.  

After frolicking along the path gathering leaves and sticks, I noticed that the suns rays were really quite beautiful.  I remembered Scott saying that one of the best times of days to get pictures is before sunset.  "Perfect, I thought."  

I sat the kids down on a bench at one of the "exercise stops" on the walking path.  You were supposed to do sit ups here.  My son saw the curved bar and thought he knew what to do.  Before I could even think about stopping him, he had flipped over the bar and landed hard on his poor little noggin.  But, I had just set the girls down for the phot opp at the same instant and I knew time was of the essence.

Poor guy didn't even have time to recover before Mom started snapping pictures.  And the girls weren't exactly ready either.  

OK...I am not exaggerating when I tell you that I proceeded to snap 28 pictures of them sitting in this pose.  They were pretty agreeable and not bouncing all over the place, which is rare for a photo opp, so I went a little over board.  (check out the shell shocked look on my baby girl's face)!

I then started second guessing myself...was this the right spot?  Where do I want the sun?  At my back?  On my side?  "Oh, how I wish Scott was here..."  

I tried switching angles...

No, this is def not right... having the subjects face the sun is def a bad idea... poor kids!  

Hmm, what about this way?

Might have worked, but Momma pushed her luck.  They were done with the sitting patiently on the bench routine.

Guess I better get a few pointers before my next attempt at amateur photography.  Check out [THAT Family](http://www.wearethatfamily.com) for more photographic laughs!
