The past week has been spring break at the circus and while it is technically true, we did break from our studies, other than that, it was a jam packed, super busy week. 

It is now Monday… school resumes tomorrow, and today I am trying to catch up on laundry and dishes and cleaning… right now, we’re back from gymnastics and the kids are down for quiet time.&#160; I am thankful for an iced coffee and the fact that it is warm enough for a skirt and flip flops…oh how I love warm sunny days!!

Since I failed to post anything all week, thought I’d try [a Project Life](http://www.themomcreative.com/2011/04/project-life-tuesday-48.html) post and do my best to sum up our week in one post using pictures and memories…

Tuesday- my son got&#160; to play catcher in his game… he was so excited!

Wednesday- We had cupcakes at the park with our friends to celebrate&#160; April birthdays (only 7 days apart from each other)&#160; Like how my son looks like Tarzan king of the playground?&#160;

Sunday- loved worshipping with my parents, Scott’s parents, and Scott’s sisters fam at church on Easter morning… loved seeing my son sitting on his Uncle Jim’s lap&#160; and my daughter nestled between grandparents as we celebrated the resurrection together.&#160;&#160; Then, we had both sets of grandparents over for an informal lunch.&#160; After everyone left we had a relaxing afternoon and spent the evening doing an egg hunt, dying some eggs, and [baking resurrection cookies](http://www.annieshomepage.com/resurrectioncookies.html).&#160; It was a wonderful day.&#160;
