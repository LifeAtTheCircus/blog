As 2009 came to a close, we spent some time as a family discussing the highlights.&#160; It really was a wonderful year!&#160; I feel so blessed for the many opportunities for family fun that we had in the past year.

This past spring we took a [family vacation to Texas](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/03/ambitious-or-crazy/).&#160; We had a wonderful time visiting family and spending time in God’s magnificent creation.

Our son was able to [play baseball](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/05/06/and-just-like-that-he-turned-me-into-a-baseball-fan/) this spring…a dream come true for him!&#160; We also got to go and see the Baltimore Orioles play twice at Camden Yards.&#160; ![batter up](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/batterup.jpg "batter up")

We&#160; spent a good deal of time as a family this spring and summer swimming and fishing.&#160; Both were highlights for the kids. 

&#160;

During the summer we welcomed [two new nephews](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/07/27/the-tale-of-two-nephews/) into our extended family.&#160;&#160; My brother and [his wife](http://www.mutheringheights.com/) and [Scott’s sister](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/) and her husband each had a baby boy this summer.&#160; We were able to visit with them both shortly after they were born and we are delighted to have them in our family!&#160;&#160; [![IMG_0351](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0351.jpg "IMG_0351")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0351.jpg) [![IMG_1449](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_1449.jpg "IMG_1449")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_1449.jpg) 

In the fall, [we began homeschooling](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/09/15/so-big-and-yet-so-small/) our son using a local tutorial.&#160; This was an answer to prayer, as a year ago, [we were not certain](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/13/still-more-questions-than-answers/) what we’d be doing for kindergarten this fall.&#160; It has been a true blessing to our family and a [![IMG_2002](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_2002.jpg "IMG_2002")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_2002.jpg)delight for us all as we learn together.&#160; 

Our oldest daughter finally got to participate in [a sport of her own](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/09/02/her-chance-to-shine/) this fall…gymnastics…it is a perfect fit for her and I can’t begin to describe the joy I get in watching her out on the floor.&#160; My favorite is watching her on the bars!&#160;&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

My baby girl is hardly a baby as she is learning and growing and absorbing new things like a dry sponge…I have a hard time reminding myself she is only 2.&#160; She&#160; loves to sing and read books and keep up with her older siblings.&#160; We also learned this fall that she won’t be the baby for long!&#160; As we look to the new year the thing we are most anticipating is the arrival of [baby number 4](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/10/29/coming-soon-to-a-circus-near-you/) this summer!

As the new year begins, I encourage you to take some time to look back and reflect on the past years blessings.&#160;&#160; Too often it is easy to&#160; focus on the urgency of today or the plans of tomorrow.&#160; But, there is much to be gained from looking back as well.&#160; For me as I look back this week, I am filled with immense gratitude.
