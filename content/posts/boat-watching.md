Living near the Chesapeake Bay affords us many opportunities for boat watching.&#160;&#160; 

“What’s that?”&#160; “A sailboat.” 

“What’s that?”&#160; “A motor boat”

“What’s that?”&#160; “A kayak.” 

Many such conversations have gone on between the kids and I over the years.&#160; Now they happily call out the boats they see as we play at the beach or the park nearby.&#160; 

Last week my kids got all excited when they saw a cruise ship sailing by our park.&#160; “Look mom, a cruise ship!”

Later my five year old called, “Hey Mom, a China boat!”

I suppose one day over the past few years my son asked about a freighter and I told him it was a boat carrying stuff to the port of Baltimore.&#160; Inevitably it was followed by a question of where the stuff came from.&#160; To which I must of replied offhandedly “China.”&#160; Hence now when my son spies a freighter carrying goods to our local port he indentifies it as a “China boat.”

Too bad, he’s probably right.
