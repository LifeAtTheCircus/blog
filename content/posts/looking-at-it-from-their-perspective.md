Last week we were at my parents house and my son came into the kitchen quite exasperated from going to the bathroom.

“Mom,” he complained, “can you puh-leeze tell the girls to put the seat up when they are done going potty?&#160; They keep leaving it down!”

I had to laugh.&#160; Women have complained for years about men leaving the seat up, but never, never have I heard a complaint about us leaving it down. 

Guess it’s all in how you look at things.&#160;
