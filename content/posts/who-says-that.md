My son has always been a thinker, thinking things through one step ahead and drawing some unpredictable conclusions.&#160; The following conversation took place last week between my son and his Daddy.

Son: Dad, I really want to go fishing.      
Dad: Oh, that does sound like fun.&#160; The bummer though is that it's not fishing season so we can't go fishing.       
Son: Why is it not fishing season?       
Dad: Well, if we fished all the time we would run out of fish to fish.&#160; Instead, we give them a break so they have a chance to have babies and make more fish.       
Son:&#160; So then we can destroy the families and eat them?
