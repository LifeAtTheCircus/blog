When the summer began I had big goals and plans for myself.&#160; I signed up for the Annapolis 10 Mile Run again this year, this time running with several of my high school friends.&#160; I had high hopes of running 3 or 4 times a week all summer.&#160; I had already envisioned how great my new, sleek running body would look come the end of August.&#160; I also enrolled in a Bible Study at a nearby church that was a hosting a Beth Moore study on the book of Esther.&#160; I was so excited to get into the word on a daily basis.&#160;&#160; 

Here it is August 14th and I have run literally a handful of times and I made it to about 3 of the Esther studies.&#160; The study is now over and I sit with a 3/4 empty workbook.&#160; The race is in 15 days and the longest I’ve run is 6 miles, and I even took a break to walk. 

One thing this summer has definitely lacked is discipline.&#160; We’ve had some great fun going fishing, swimming, cook outs, trips downtown… and I’ve loved every minute of it.

But, I’ve also developed some bad habits.&#160; Staying up late is one…sleeping in the next morning is the other.&#160; Each week I tell myself, that next week I gotta start getting up early so I can have a quiet time and run before the kids wake up.&#160; And each week I find myself staying up late watching tv or commenting on blogs till midnight or beyond.&#160; 

Our school years stars on Sept 14th with our tutorial.&#160; I plan to officially start school here at the circus the week after Labor Day. But,&#160; I’ve got three weeks in the middle to get myself on track.&#160; 

I really feel that mornings at the circus would be less circus like if I was up, had some me time, and showered before my kids woke up.&#160; Then instead of struggling to wake up myself, I could greet them with the energy and attention they crave in the morning.&#160; Since the crew likes to wake up at 7 (or earlier), I need to make a conscious effort to be up by 6.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

I once heard or read somewhere that as moms we need to be the thermostats for the house.&#160; We need to set the tone and environment for everyone else rather than simply reacting to the chaos.&#160;&#160; I try to keep that mental image in mind as the chaos invokes around me.&#160; I don’t think getting up at 6 is going to rid my life of chaos, but I do think it could help to set a better tone in the mornings.&#160; 

So, this week, I’m going to try again.&#160; I’m going to run in the remaining 15 days I have till race day and I’m going to work through my Bible study workbook on my own.&#160; I am confident that God still has much to teach me through the study of His word.&#160; And while I know I won’t be as fit on race day as I could have been, I figure better late than not at all in the training department. 

##### Lamentations 3:22-23 (New International Version)

_**Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed,          
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; for his compassions never fail.** _

_**They are new every morning;          
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; great is your faithfulness.**_
