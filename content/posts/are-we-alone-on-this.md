My kids have a fascination with poop.  

(Have no fear [no pictures](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/14/sometimes-life-s-t-i-n-k-s/) included in this post)!

Every time we change our baby's diaper, the older two want to know if it is poop and if it is they want to see it.  

As odd as it is to us, it seems like an easy and harmless enough wish to comply with that my husband and I know "don't throw the diaper into the pail until you've held it up for all to see."  

I am not a mom that laughs at her kids pain.  I consider myself to be 
 somewhat of a softy
 tender hearted.   

But today, I did have to turn my head to hide my chuckle as I listened in on my husband and son's conversation. 
 > Son crying
> 
> Husband:  What is wrong?
> 
> Son:  You didn't let me see the poop
> 
> (ok for real he isn't just whining here... REAL tears are streaming down his face)
> 
> Husband:  No, you were in the room when I changed her diaper, I held it up and called for anyone who wanted to see the poopy diaper to come see
> 
> Son:  But I didn't see it
> 
> Husband:  Then it is your fault, you sister came and saw it, I told you about it.  
> 
> Son:  still crying  (I just want to point out that he isn't a cry baby who cries over every little thing...he is crying because he is genuinely distraught and utterly disappointed).
> 
> (this is my favorite line) Husband:  I knew how important this was to you, I was surprised to find you crying because I thought you had seen the poop. 

Eventually the issue is resolved as Dad pointed out he did his part, he wasn't being mean, and I reminded my son that she poops pretty much every day so he can always check it out tomorrow.

My husband and I exchanged looks which communicated, "Who knew looking at poop was so important?"  and "Can you believe I just had that conversation?"

I'm just wondering....are my kids weird?  Are we alone on this?  Or do you have similar conversations in your house?
