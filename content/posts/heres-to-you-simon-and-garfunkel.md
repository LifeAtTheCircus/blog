If summer could have a theme song, well then I think this would be&#160; mine for the summer of 2010.
  > Slow down, you move too fast.       
> You got to make the morning last.        
> Just kicking down the cobble stones.        
> Looking for fun and feelin' groovy.
> 
> Ba da, Ba da, Ba da, Ba da...Feelin' Groovy.       
> 
> Hello lamp-post,       
> What cha knowin'?        
> I've come to watch your flowers growin'.        
> Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?        
> Doot-in' doo-doo,        
> Feelin' groovy.
> 
> I've got no deeds to do,       
> No promises to keep.        
> I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep.        
> Let the morning time drop all its petals on me.        
> Life, I love you,        
> All is groovy.  


Last year was a busy one here at the circus… it was my first year as a home schooling mom and I was pregnant on top of that.&#160;&#160; I struggled with how to balance it all… the house work, the school work, friends… and the place that gave was friends (not that the other 2 were handled perfectly mind you).&#160;&#160; But, we didn’t spend much time with our friends last year.

Summer has been so refreshing… like one [Countrytime Lemonade](http://brands.kraftfoods.com/countrytime/) commercial after another.&#160;&#160; We’ve had so many fun get togethers with friends and I have found myself (a devout introvert) refreshed by the times spent together.&#160;

[![IMG_1269](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/IMG_1269.jpg "IMG_1269")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/IMG_1269.jpg) With July almost behind us and August waiting eagerly around the corner, I find myself wanting to slow time down and “make the morning last”.&#160; How I love snuggling my little guy and watching my big 3 play in the back yard.&#160; We’ve got one more month to kick down the cobble stones and feel groovy.&#160; Then school returns and with it soccer practice (x2 this year), gymnastics (x2 this year) cub Scouts and Karate classes…. I do believe our theme song for the fall will be something along the lines of “the wheels on the minivan go round and round…”



Until then I must force myself to do all I can to savor and bottle up these care free days.

Can you believe how quickly he is growing?&#160; Slow down little man… your moving WAY to FAST!!!
