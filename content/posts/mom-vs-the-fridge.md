When asked what it was like to [get the power back](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/06/were-baaaaaaaaack/) on Friday, I replied " A lot of work."  

After throwing away the spoiled food inside of my fridge and freezer, this is what I faced.

After an hour of scrubbing...

Here are a few tips I learned from the cleaning process.  

*    If your [power goes out](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/05/no-electricity-water-or-internet/) and everything in your fridge spoils, clean out the freezer BEFORE the power comes back on and all the melted stuff in your freezer refreezes.
*   When you pour hot water in the freezer to melt the ice, don't just dump an entire glass full of hot water into the freezer.  Instead, just slowly pour what you need to melt the ice (because you will have to wipe out all of that water before it freezes).
*   When cleaning out the freezer door be careful and don't let your baby daughter sit under you, because everything you wipe out will drop in the crack of the door and onto your poor baby girl (thus lea ving you to give her a bath AND mop the floor after you finish with the freezer.

This week I tackled my fridge and freezer, not exactly by choice, but they haven't looked this clean since we moved in.   To see what other people are tackling, check out [5 Minutes for Mom.](http://5MinutesForMom.com)
