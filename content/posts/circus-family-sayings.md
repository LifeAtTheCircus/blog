Scott and I have a few sayings&#160; that we use often with the kids. 

Life is not Fair

Life isn’t Always About You

You Can’t Cry to Get What You Want

and….

Never Trust a Bad Guy

1 -3 are pretty self explanatory… in a family of 6, you learn quickly that your not going to get what you want when you want it, you gotta wait, and that’s just the way it goes.&#160;&#160; I try hard to remember who had the blue plate yesterday and who got to use the dog towel last after the bath, but you know… I can’t always keep track of it.&#160; And while we do our best to keep things balanced, it’s just going to happen that someone is going to spend the night at a friends house and your not necessarily going to get to that same night.&#160; It’s a hard pill to swallow and it often stinks… but you know, it is life.&#160; And I’ll confess quite often, I need to remind myself of these same things… b/c sometimes I too want it to be all about me… sometimes I too get irritated when life doesn’t seem fair, and sometimes I too just want to sit and cry when things don’t go my way.&#160; 

So, we find ourselves repeating these truths… often.

I had to laugh when the girls were watching a DVD one day on the portable DVD player… some sort of “discussion” was taking place over the fact that one of them was holding it and not the other… I listened in to see if I was going to need to step in soon…
  > “It’s not fair that you get to hold it and I don’t!”&#160; the younger complained…
> 
> “Well, remember, life’s not fair!” the older responded…  


Yea… Mom had to step in and keep the peace during that little discussion…though I did inwardly chuckle and that application of a truth she’s obviously heard often…



A few weeks later the older 3 were arguing at the table and again one of them tried to pull the ol “life isn’t fair” card… this time the 5 yr old complained, “ I hate that they always say that to me… except for my sister she always says, _“Remember what Dad always says, Never Trust a Bad Guy!”_ 



This made me laugh out loud.&#160; 



When watching movies Scott often points out how untrustworthy bad guys are… when one bad guy will trust another bad guy, he’ll always say, “Remember never trust a bad guy.”&#160;&#160; And inevitably later in that episode or movie that bad guy will have been double crossed and he’ll point out how it wasn’t a good idea to trust a bad guy.”&#160; 



I just love that my 4 yr old goes around saying that completely out of context… totally made me laugh… picture it…

So, I guess you have it… our family sayings… I had to chuckle when thinking about those [cute little personalized subway art signs](http://www.according-to-kelly.com/2010/07/personalized-subway-art-from-tatertots-jello/) with family sayings that you see all over the blogosphere these days… don’t think ours would make for a very cute DIY project.&#160;&#160;&#160; But, then again, I’m not that crafty anyways!
