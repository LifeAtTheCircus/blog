2008 was a good year at the Circus.  

In February, I was blessed with a new [niece](http://mutheringheights.blogspot.com/).  You wouldn't have known this though because I didn't [begin blogging](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/03/27/here-we-go/) until the end of March. The spring was also filled with fun family activities like going to a real [circus](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/13/under-the-big-top-part-2/), [celebrating Easter](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/23/behold-the-power-of-oxicleanbehold-the-power-of-oxiclean/), and watching the Blue Angels.   Summer held a trip to the [beach](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/25/a-day-at-the-beach/), [patriotic celebrations](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/04/happy-fourth/), [my birthday](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/17/princess-for-a-day/), [camping](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/28/why-we-love-camping/), sailboat races, and a [reunion with friends](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/27/the-lucky-ones/).  My baby also [turned one](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/18/i-am-one-busy-mama-tonight/) this summer.  How did that happen??  I trained for and ran in the [Annapolis 10 Mile Race](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/25/we-did-it/).  It was a big accomplishment for me and I was so excited to achieve my goal.  

Fall marked a new stage of life as my little boy grew up.  Talk about time flying, he began preschool and [soccer](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/09/18/worth-a-thousand-words-and-then-some/) and suddenly didn't seem so little anymore.  We enjoyed a day at the [farm](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/10/16/the-power-of-a-baby/), [the county fair](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/09/17/and-i-thought-i-had-it-bad/), and the [pumpkin](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/11/07/better-late-than-never-right/) patch.  I also took a trip to Texas with friends for a [MOPS convention](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/10/01/mommys-leaving-on-a-jet-plane/) (and sang karaoke for the first time).  

And then the holiday season rushed in with [costumes,](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/11/01/trick-or-treat/) [turkeys](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/11/27/a-time-to-give-thanks/), and a month long celebration of [our Lords birth](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/20/thats-what-its-all-about/) with the [sights](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/30/christmas-in-the-capital/), sounds, [smells](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/12/o-christmas-tree/), and [tastes](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/16/its-cookie-baking-time/) found only during the Christmas season.  Somewhere in there my oldest daughter became officially potty trained.  Yes, for Thanksgiving, I was given  one more thing to be thankful for...2 potty trained and only one kiddo in diapers!

As I look to 2009, I can only wonder what new circus acts await us.  There are a few 1/2 marathons I'd like to run this spring and fall.  We'd like to go to Texas to see my [SIL](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/) and BIL this summer as well as do some camping in the great [southwest](http://www.nps.gov/state/tx/).  My son will start kindergarten this fall!!!  I am [still not sure](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/13/still-more-questions-than-answers/) if I will be home schooling him or sending him to school.  And there are many more adventures that I don't even have the slightest idea about.  

Scott and I would like to be more intentional with our time this year.  We'd like to read  more and spend more time in [the Word](http://www.biblegateway.com/resources/readingplans/index.php/2009/01/01?plan=2&amp;version=31).  I'm eager to see how the Lord can use us for His purposes in the coming year.  I am excited about the fresh start and the new year.  

By the way, this New Year's post, is extra special because it is also my 300th post!!  That means I have written 300 posts in only 9 months!  Thanks so much for reading and commenting; you don't know how much you brighten my day!  

Happy New Year from the Circus!!
