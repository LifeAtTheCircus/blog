Without having to pay thousands of dollars to fly to the Caribbean for a few days, we in the Maryland area were blessed with a week of spring weather in February.&#160; And the Circus kids and I soaked up every precious minute of it.&#160; I had my kids outside as much as possible this week.&#160; Biking, Swinging, Picnicking, digging, and wading…

Rumor has it snow could fall here next week.&#160; And while I really want to whine and complain, begging for spring, I must remember that it is February 18th and we went barefoot today.&#160; We were given a gift… a vacation from the norm.&#160; I will say thanks for our reprieve and cling to the hope that soon enough we will have many more weeks like this one.
