I have become a procrastinator.&#160; Actually I am worse than a procrastinator b/c procrastinators put things off till the last minute and then get them done.&#160; I didn’t used to be this way but now I tend to put them off till the last minute and then the deadline passes and I am still left with the job undone.&#160; 

Case in point: I bought my mom her mothers day card at the end of April.&#160; I brought it to PA with me at the beginning of May to deliver with my gift.&#160; But, I didn’t sign it, thinking, “Oh I will sign it when I get there.”&#160; And the card rode back to MD with me, unsigned where it sat in the back of the passenger seat until today 8 DAYS AFTER MOTHERS DAY when I finally signed it and mailed my mom her card.&#160; 

As if that wasn’t bad enough today I also mailed my BIL his birthday package for his birthday on April 9th.&#160; I wish I could say I forgot his birthday and that is why it was late.&#160; I didn’t forget, I knew about it, even got him a card, but had trouble deciding on his gift and kept waiting to find the right thing, and well… it should arrive about 2 mths late.&#160; Here’s hoping that he feels that it’s “better late than never.” 

After my belated post office trip, I then went to the library.&#160; A place I have been avoiding for the past month or so.

Every time I come home from the library, my husband jokingly asks, “How much will this trip cost us?”&#160; 

Well, back in March, I checked out some books and when I went to return them (already overdue b/c for the life of me I can not figure out how to return my books on time… even when I make notes on the calendar I still don’t manage to get them in on time) I couldn’t find two books.&#160; I thought for sure they would turn up but was scurrying to pack for our [Texas trip](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/02/traveling-circus/) and just kinda ignored it.&#160; 

Funny how library books don’t just magically appear and return themselves when you are on vacation.&#160; 

When I got home, the books still did not appear and I renewed them in hopes of them turning up in that time. 

Yes, I know it would have been smarter to renew them right away when I realized they were missing, and I thought about it, but never followed through…something about packing up my family of 5 for a [2 week trek across Texas](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/03/ambitious-or-crazy/)…

So today I finally succumbed to that fact that those [Clifford books](http://pbskids.org/clifford/index-brd-flash.html) were not turning up.&#160; 

And I went to pay my bill. 

$18.00 in over due fines 

+ cost for 2 lost books

= **$42.09** in library fees 

My daughter asked if we could check out another book and I told her no.&#160; Mommy needs to figure out a system for keeping track of and returning our books before we take any more home.&#160; 

So, while I go to work on my MIL’s belated mother’s day gift, I wanna know…what’s the most you’ve paid at the “free” library for your books?&#160; I bet I have you beat.
