One day my 4 year old came to me with about 8 pony tail holders and asked me to put them all in her hair.&#160; I was surprised with how cute it turned out and she was excited when she received compliments on it from her friend at church.&#160; After realizing how well it stayed in, I decided it might be worth trying this for gymnastics.&#160;&#160;&#160; (_this is it after a night of sleep)_[_![IMG_2235](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2235.jpg "IMG_2235")_](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2235.jpg)

So, we tried it out for gymnastics that Tuesday.&#160; After their classes, my 5 year old told me she gives me 1 point for her hair that day b/c it stayed in, but was loose at the end.&#160; Her sister however awarded me 3 points b/c not only did it stay in, but her teacher told her she liked it.&#160; 

And so it began.&#160;&#160; 

It, of course, being, my receiving scores for how I style my daughters hair for gymnastics.&#160;&#160; (_because you know there isn’t enough pressure already as a mom…)_

Each day before class we started allowing extra time when getting ready so I could do something special to their hair.&#160; They always have something in mind that they want, and I try my bestest to make it happen.&#160; And after class they’d come out and tell me my score.&#160; 

This fancy do right here earned me a 300 from my 4 year old (even though the barrette fell out in class).&#160;

This caused me to delve further into their grading scale.&#160; Basically, my 4 year old is happy if I use a lot of pony tail holders, someone compliments her and it doesn’t all fall out.&#160; She’s easy to please, and more about style than function.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

My 5 year old is a tougher judge.&#160; She informed me that the highest score I could receive is a 10.&#160; When I asked her what I could do to earn a 10 she told me, “Well mom, you could just do a pony tail, just a pony tail, and if at the end of class all my hairs stayed in and none were falling out, that would be a 10).&#160;&#160; So, with her the issue isn’t number of compliments, number of pony tails, or even style.&#160; It’s all about function. 

hmmmmm

Well, it turns out that if you sleep in a head full of braids, you wake up the next day with wavy hair.&#160; This was a big hit.&#160; In fact, when she wore her hair to the tutorial the next day with two tiny pony tails and the rest all wavy, it went over very well.&#160; (_whew… perhaps redeeming the 1 point score from the night before_)

The next day for gymnastics, she told me that she wanted 2 little braids to come together into a pony tail.&#160; This seemed much easier than the 5 braids I had attempted on Tuesday.&#160; And it combined a little bit of style to the function of a pony tail.

Actually, I think the style helped with the function, as the braids helped keep those loose shorter hairs from flying out during class.&#160; This was of course critical to my scoring at the end of class. 

My score?&#160; 

100 points!&#160; 

(_off the charts baby!_)
