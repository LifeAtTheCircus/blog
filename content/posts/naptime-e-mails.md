Naptime is sacred at my house.&#160; At night all three kids share a room b/c it really doesn’t bother me if they stay up late talking and singing.&#160; But at nap time every one goes to a different room.&#160; My son no longer naps, but he still goes to his “nap room” for quiet time where he may look at books or draw or play quietly for an hour and a half.

For the last few weeks my oldest daughter has wanted to work on “school work” during nap time like her brother.&#160; (which means she wants crayons and papers in her room too).&#160; I didn’t object, as long as she promised to go to sleep after doing “school” for a little while. 

Not long after, I heard a door open, then another, some whispers and two closed doors.&#160;&#160; I ignored it at first.&#160; But after about 10 minutes of doors opening and closing, I feared they’d wake their youngest sister so I went back to see what was up. 

My daughter informed me they were sending “e-mails” to each other. 

And it was one of those things that was just so cute, that despite the fact that I knew I should make them stop and go to sleep, sucker that I am, I let them keep “e-mailing” as long as they stayed quiet.&#160; 

Their e-mails consisted of pictures and messages which they would write and then deliver to each other. 

This one happens to me my favorite.&#160; My son drew it for his sister.&#160; He also wrote their names at the top in “kid font.”&#160; I totally confiscated it for my file of precious mementos.&#160;&#160; [![IMG_2715](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_2715.jpg "IMG_2715")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_2715.jpg)
