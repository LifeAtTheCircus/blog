It’s been a few years since we’ve had a good snow fall here in MD.&#160; And by good I mean accumulating enough so that you don’t see the grass poking through the snow.&#160; 

This is the only snowman we were able to scrape together this winter at the circus.&#160; Don’t the kids look kind of forlorn?&#160;

Seriously, take a closer look at our “snowman.”&#160; I am sure my friends up north are rolling on the floor with laughter at our patheticness.

Since Old Man Winter, didn’t provide us with much of the white stuff here, we decided to have our own snowman day.&#160; I’d been planning to do it in Jan and then suddenly I found myself a week from March and panicking b/c a snowman day in March with the St Patty’s decor up, just wouldn’t have the right feel.&#160; Originally, I had planned to invite a bunch of the kids friends over and have a big party with snacks and crafts and the like.&#160; But, I was running out of time and out [of social energy](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/02/23/a-circus-hodgepodge/), so we settled on a low key snowman day at home.&#160;&#160; 

We started the day snuggled up in our pjs watching Frosty the Snowman.

&#160; After naptime our family friend stopped by and joined us in making our own indoor snowman out of ivory snow detergent and water.&#160; The super easy recipe can be found [here](http://jas.familyfun.go.com/arts-and-crafts?craftid=10675&amp;page=CraftDisplay).&#160; (tip: I found I had to keep adding in a lot more of the detergent though to get it to a thick enough consistency to form our “snowballs”).&#160; I really think that these turned out cuter than our “real” snowman.

&#160;&#160; So even though it looks like we’ll go yet one more winter without a [“scrapbookable”](http://www.wearethatfamily.com/2009/02/sincerely-fro-me-to-you-next-step.html)&#160; snow fall here in the middle east coast, at least we can say we had our fun with snowmen!
