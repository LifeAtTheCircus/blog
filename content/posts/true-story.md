Last night I fed my family a dinner so lacking in nutritional value or substance that it makes the time we had ice cream for dinner look healthy. 

I kid you not. 

We’ve been burning the candle at both ends round the circus parts the past week… finishing up projects at the old house, organizing the new house, having company, throwing a birthday party…having more company… somehow yesterday it ended up 8pm, the Olympics were on and we’d all been looking forward to watching them… we hadn’t eaten dinner. I had ZERO plans for dinner and so we went down to the basement, sat on the couch and I brought down dinner. 

A bag of Doritos

A package of white Oreos

and in an attempt to slightly assuage my guilt, a bowl of grapes.

Yes, I know, I can just go ahead and toss that notion of ever getting nominated for Mom of the Year out the window…
