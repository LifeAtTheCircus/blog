He is no longer a preschooler.  

I’m so proud of him.  I love the way his little mind works, always processing, always questioning.  He’s got his Daddy’s logical brain.   I look forward to watching him continue to grow and develop through the years.  And yet, I wish I could freeze time right now, right where he is.  I love that he still loves to snuggle.  And I dread the day when he doesn’t want to curl up on my lap on the couch anymore.  

There’s going to be a ceremony and performance at his school this morning.  He’s been talking about it all week.  I can’t wait to see him sing his songs with his classmates.  He told me tonight he gets to wear a special vest and hat too.  I’ll be bringing my tissues.  

Afterwards there’s going to be celebration for the families.  So, I made [these little grad caps](http://jas.familyfun.go.com/recipefinder/display?id=50237) for the picnic.

They were super easy to make and I think they’ll provide a cute touch to the festivities.
