When I was pulling out Christmas decorations from the storage closet I came across a box of pictures...perfect for my weekly blast from the past post.  (I've got a few more set aside for the upcoming weeks).

If you notice, there is a Christmas tree in the background here.  Every week my family did an advent devotional on Sunday evenings.  We'd read a passage of Scripture, light the candle and sing some Christmas carols.    

Once I started to play the flute in fourth grade, I wanted to accompany the family in our advent singing.  

And my incredibly gracious and loving family obliged me.

Those of you who have had the pleasure of listening to beginners band can get a picture.   

So they sang along slowly as I accompanied them.   In high school I started playing the flugal horn and again asked my family if I could play along with them.  And again they patiently put up with my pitiful accompaniment.   Cute when I was 9, but in ninth grade....hmm...

I look back on the days with fond memories.  My family wasn't the Von Trapp Family by any stretch.  But still we sang out praises to our Lord and made memories to cherish for years to come.  I hope my kids can say the same of their growing up years.
