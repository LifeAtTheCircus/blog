[![IMG_4298](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-4298-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-4298.jpg)This weekend my husband and my son went&#160; away for a Father/Son camping trip.&#160; More pics and details to follow later this week.&#160; For now, it's girl time!!

&#160;

I stayed home with the two girls.&#160;&#160; We had a wonderful time playing and bonding. We baked chocolate chip cookies.&#160; Because a girl has got to have her chocolate fix, right?&#160; 

&#160;

And then to be completely stereotypical, I took them shopping at the mall.&#160; I [![IMG_4328](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-4328-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img-4328.jpg) am not really a big mall shopper.&#160; I don't find the mall to be the most economical place for me to purchase things.&#160; I typically use the mall as an event, we walk around, we eat some food, we look at the animals at the pet store.&#160; This trip was no exception.&#160; Except since our sole purpose was just to spend time together and I was in no hurry to get anything or be anywhere, we, as my daughter put it, &quot;played mall.&quot;&#160; We all got dressed up first, fixing our hair and wearing the our bright pink clothes.&#160; Mommy even wore a skirt so she could look pretty like the girls.&#160;&#160; We got our pink purses and I let my two year old bring her baby doll and stroller so she could push her baby while I pushed mine.&#160;&#160; This was the highlight of both of our day.

My daughter told me as we were leaving that she had so much fun &quot;playing mall&quot; today.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While we all missed the boys and were eager for them to return home to us, the time by ourselves was good.&#160;&#160; My middle child got to be the the big kid for the weekend.&#160; She got to set the stage for things and be in the spotlight.&#160; In a lot of ways it was her weekend to shine.&#160; She impressed me with things she knew that I didn't know she knew (like counting and certain shapes).&#160;&#160; And my baby for some reason seemed a little less baby like as the two of them were playing on the floor with each other.&#160;
