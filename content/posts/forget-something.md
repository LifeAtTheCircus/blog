Last week I mentioned on face book that I love how Scott makes me a pot of coffee every morning. 

And, I do. 

Makes me smile each morning when I come to the kitchen and pour myself a cup.

And I smile again later that morning as I go back to top it off.&#160;&#160; Again… and again.

 Thursday, however, I had to laugh when I went to pour my cup of coffee.&#160; 

Seems he forgot something when making my morning “I love you.”

While he did put the coffee beans in the grinder, change the filter, add the water, and turned it on, he forgot one very important step.

Putting the coffee pot back into the machine.

I wonder if perhaps he too could benefit from a morning cup of caffeine.
