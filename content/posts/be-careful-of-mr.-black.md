Today a dental hygienist visited my son’s class at preschool.&#160; 

In the car he told me we needed to get him some dental cloth.&#160; 

“Floss?” I asked.&#160; 

“Yes,” he told me, “We gotta get rid of Mr. Black.”

pause

My son then commented, “I have no idea who Mr. Black is but we gotta get rid of him.”

I suggested maybe he was a cavity. 

“Yea or dead food.” he replied.

So, this week at the circus we are tackling dental hygiene.&#160; He even told my husband before bed tonight that when he wakes up he’s gotta brush his teeth.&#160; “Of course I’ll come into your room first, b/c I always come into your room when I wake up, but then I gotta brush my teeth because we need to brush in the morning and night.”

I am so glad we have him to keep us all in line.
