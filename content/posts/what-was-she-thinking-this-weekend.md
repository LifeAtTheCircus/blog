I’m sorry.&#160; Really I am.&#160; I had every intention of posting a [thought this weekend](http://lifeatthecircus.com/?s=weekend+thoughts) and here it is Sunday night and I haven’t posted since Thursday!!&#160; 

Last week was my first week back into the real world.&#160; For the past 5 years I for the most part lived without an alarm.&#160; I’d wake when the kids woke, and our day would begin, sloooooowly after that.&#160; Now that we’re in Kindergarten I’m up at 6 and getting the circus crew fed, dressed and ready to start the day by 8 am.&#160; We did it.&#160; But, man was I exhausted by Friday.&#160; 

Top that with a fun filled field trip to the county fair on Friday morning (after completing our schoolwork) and an afternoon spent cleaning and cooking for a weekend filled with company, and well, you get one tired Momma.&#160;

Friday night we had the pleasure of entertaining cousin Joel who was in town visiting during his R&amp;R from Afghanistan.&#160; We did our best to give him a hero’s welcome.&#160; The kids had a blast clamoring for his attention.&#160; And Scott and I appreciated the chance to talk and catch up with him…he even stuck around to help hang up my entryway shelf downstairs.&#160; My [entry way makeover](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/08/03/tackling-the-entry-way/) is finally complete and I LOVE IT!&#160; (I must add that I enjoyed watching my hubby, his cousin, and his Grandpa work together on a project for me).&#160; What great guys!!&#160;&#160; 

Joel pulled out of our driveway and less than 2 minutes later my parents pulled in.&#160; Saturday morning we woke early and Scott headed off for a weekend sailing race at the same time I headed out for a 5K to support the local pregnancy center.&#160; (thanks to grandma and grandpa for babysitting) I got home in time to shower and get ready for my son’s soccer game.&#160; (where he scored a goal… 2 weeks in a row now… yeah, I am one proud momma) 

And really, the pace never slowed down all weekend… with a birthday party, church, football games… fantasy teams to catch up on, tailgate food to prepare….somehow it’s now Sunday night and I’ve gotta gear up for another week!!&#160; Thought it was action pack, I truly enjoyed the weekend…not so thrilled with my boys in black and gold, but was glad my family got to watch the game with my parents.&#160; Big thanks to mom and dad for sticking around till 7 and making a LATE night drive home just so you could watch with us!
