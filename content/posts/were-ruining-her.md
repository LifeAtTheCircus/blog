Since we first brought my youngest home from the hospital at two days old, she has been a good sleeper.&#160; You could just lay her down and walk away and she would soothe herself to sleep.&#160;&#160; Scott and I commented a few months ago that we haven’t had to go in the middle of the night to help soothe her back to sleep.&#160;&#160; Even when she threw up in her crib in the middle of the night, she just rolled back over and went to sleep.&#160; We never knew till morning.&#160; She was my low maintenance baby.

Was being the operative word.&#160; 

Then we went on our grand Texas vacation.

Since we have gotten back, she has been incredibly clingy.&#160; I was paged by the nursery at church on Sunday b/c she was crying so hard.&#160;&#160; She wants held by me all the time and fights with her siblings if they are in my lap or arms.&#160; 

And bed time has become the battle to end all battles.&#160;&#160; Since we returned home a week ago,&#160; she has screamed and cried when we put her to bed.&#160; I am talking screaming at the top of her lungs for up to an hour.&#160; The first night,she was screaming, “No sleep, I want couch,in living room, to watch movie, monkey.”&#160; 

What??&#160; 

Since when did she say living room? 

And when has she ever slept on the couch while watching a movie? 

The other morning at 3 am she woke and was screaming, “No sleep, No sleep.&#160; I want down.&#160; I want out.”&#160; 

I have gone in and soothed, but she then just screams louder when I leave.&#160; I have given her a drink.&#160; I have talked to her.&#160; I have let her cry it out for HOURS, she doesn’t cave.&#160; 

This morning after she was up from 5-7am,Scott went in and took her out.&#160; She came in to our bed and promptly fell asleep beside me.

I think we’re developing some bad habits here.

We’ve ruined our low maintenance, self soothing baby.

Tonight I am trying something new.&#160; 

Because our current plan isn’t working.&#160; 

I’m going to put all three kids together in the same room.&#160; It is my hypothesis, that she misses being with her siblings.&#160; I am thinking about moving her to the big girl toddler bed b/c every night she keeps asking for it.&#160; Her big sister LOVES to sleep on the floor, so I think I am going to let her sleep on the floor until we get the bunk beds for the big kids.&#160; 

We’ll see if this works. 

I could end up with a whole other problem of a three year old who doesn’t want to sleep in her bed but only wants to sleep on the floor.&#160; 

But desperate times, call for desperate measures.&#160;
