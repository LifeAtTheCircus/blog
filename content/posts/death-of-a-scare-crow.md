My oldest two kids and I decided to commemorate the beautiful fall weather this week, by making our very first scare crow.  Because we don't live on a farm and straw is horribly overpriced in these city parts, we opted to stuff our scare crow girl with leaves.  We built her during our baby's nap time, but she woke just in time to watch us put the finishing touches on her.[![IMG_8485](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/img-8485-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/img-8485.jpg)   

I love the look of pure joy on my son's face as he draws the face on "scare crow girl" (named because of her long leafy hair and the big gold necklace around her neck)

Turns out the necklace would be the cause of her demise.  Because when baby sister woke up from her nap and we introduced her to our new friend, she instantly wanted the necklace.  And of course she reached out to grab it.

Look at the look of complete annoyance and dismay on my son's face.

"Mommy, I didn't mean to kill her!"
