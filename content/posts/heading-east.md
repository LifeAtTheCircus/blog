After leaving the Badlands, we were Eastward bound and on the homeward stretch.&#160; We planned lots of fun stops for this part of the journey, knowing it was the final stretch and wanting to change it up a bit and keep things fun and exciting. 

Our first such stop was in Sioux Falls, SD.&#160; I found a hotel there that had a water slide and a splash pool.&#160; There was also a put put course in town.&#160; After a short 4 and a half hour drive, we arrived at our hotel with plenty of time to play.&#160;&#160;&#160; I was surprised that even the littlest circus member enjoyed the big water slide.&#160; He went down&#160; all by himself with his floaty and Daddy caught him at the end.&#160; [![water slide collage](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/water-slide-collage.jpg "water slide collage")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/water-slide-collage.jpg)

After playing in the pool, we enjoyed pizza in our room and finished watching Wreck it Ralph (the movie we started at our last hotel/pizza night).&#160; Then it was off to put put!

The next morning we woke up and drove another 4 and half hours to Iowa where we stayed with a college friend of ours and his family.&#160; We hadn’t met his wife or son before and they all welcomed us with open arms and the royal treatment.&#160; The kids were delighted to have a new friend to play with.&#160; After introductions, we quickly set off for a walk to the nearby playground followed by a delicious cook out. Then the kids enjoyed playing Legos and Wii together before finishing the evening off with banana splits!!&#160;&#160;

As if all that wasn’t wonderful enough, after a great night of sleep, the kids squeezed in some more Lego fun and then we were treated to yummy doughnuts before hitting the road.&#160;&#160;&#160; I felt completely spoiled!&#160;

We may be on the homeward stretch, but the good times keep on coming!
