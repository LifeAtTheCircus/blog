March was a rough month at the circus.&#160; Scott had some deadlines at work which meant he worked a lot of overtime.&#160; This happens with his work and we’ve all learned to roll with it, but that doesn’t mean that the long days don’t eventually start to take their toll.&#160; 

On all of us

Which is why it’s been so great the last 2 weeks having Scott around more often.&#160; Last Monday he left work at 2 to go to DC with us, on Friday he got home at 5:30 (to which my oldest son asked, “Dad did you take vacation time to get home this early?”), Monday he was home by 5 and Tuesday he took the whole day off!&#160; 

He had to use vacation time to do this, but after the many, many late nights in March, we all felt it a good use of vacation time to have him home.&#160; Especially since we’re on spring break this week.&#160;

I am not a girl who typically enjoys surprises.&#160; I am a planner and greatly enjoy the anticipation of an event.&#160; But, I gotta tell you, having my hubby home on a random, unexpected Tuesday, was PURE BLISS!&#160;
