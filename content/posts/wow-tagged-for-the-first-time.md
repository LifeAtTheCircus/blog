My sweet sister in law, [Jessie](http://mutheringheights.blogspot.com/) , tagged me with this "Share the Love" award in which you tag the blogs of people whose blogs you enjoy reading.  

The rules are to tag bloggers who make your day, make you laugh and smile, and/or leave uplifting comments on your blog. You then include a link to [this post](http://www.memoirsofamommyblog.com/2008/05/new-award-to-give-away.html) , and ask each person you tag to do the same!  

Soooo, time to share the love my friends!  

Hmmm, well the blogs I read daily, that make my day are typically other stay at home mommies who find humor in what many might consider the mundane.   I feel like many of you are kindred spirits and if we lived in the same town, I am certain we'd be friends.  Some of you I know in real life, like [Sarah](http://grshortstop.blogspot.com/) - mom of three boys, and [Megan](http://www.mmdemontaigne.blogspot.com/) mother of two, both of whom I know from college, 2 different colleges, mind you.   Others of you I only met in bloggyland, but I consider you friends as I read about your love for your Lord, your husband, and your children.  There's my friend [Monica](http://dailydwelling.com) whose been married a little longer than me and has kids about the same age, but her husband is deployed in Iraq while she holds down the fort in Germany.  Then there's [Jessica](http://farmfreshiowa.blogspot.com/) , who lives in a beautiful farm house in Iowa and is pregnant with her third child.  I also get to read about life as a mother and preachers wife in "Tinytown" on  [Sarah](http://lifeintheparsonage.blogspot.com/) 's blog.  And [WGM] (http://worldsgreatestmommy.blogspot.com/) makes me laugh with her antics of life with 5 (and I thought my life was a circus)!  

I can't forget [Kristen](http://weareTHATfamily.com) .  Her blog was the first blog I visited with frequency that wasn't some one I knew in real life.  I remember telling all my friends about her, because she was so down to earth and seemed like someone we would hang out with in real life.  After about 2-3 weeks of lurking on her blog, I ended up writing my own and then realizing the importance of commenting and thus started commenting on hers.  

And last, but definitely not least, my dear family members.  Both of my sister in laws, whom I love like sisters, check my blog daily and comment with frequency.  They boost my self-esteem when I wonder if anyone is reading this.  [Jessie](http://mutheringheights.blogspot.com/) is married to my brother.  She writes with humor about the joys of being married to my little brother and raising two beautiful little girls.  I married [Karen'](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/) s brother.  She writes of life as an army wife and shares her crafty projects (which make me jealous that I am not so talented) and fun anecdotes.  

So, thanks dear bloggers for writing so faithfully.  You are all in my google reader and I eagerly look forward to reading about your lives each and every day.  So consider yourselves tagged.
