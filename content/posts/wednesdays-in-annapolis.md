It’s funny how a simple thing like dinner on a Wednesday night can have an dramatic impact on your life.&#160; 

7 years ago we went out to dinner with another couple in downtown Annapolis on a Wednesday night.&#160; If you know anything about summer in Annapolis then you know that Wednesday nights mean sailing races. (Truth is I grew up around here and just learned that fact 7 years ago). 

When I saw the boats I thought “Hmm nice boats, cool.&#160; Ok, what’s for dinner?”&#160;&#160; But Scott and Tim talked nonstop about the boats and races.&#160; Turns out Tim had a sailboat and was setting the stage for recruiting crew.

That fall Scott joined Tim on his boat for a Saturday fall race.&#160; Little did I know that was just the beginning.&#160;

That spring our son was born and sailing season started a few weeks later.&#160; 

And the rest is history.&#160;&#160; 

Every Wednesday night from late April till early September for the past 6 years, he’s been out on the bay.&#160; 

And as much as possible, the kids and I are cheering him on.&#160; 

I can remember when it felt like so much work to go out there with a baby.&#160; More often than not I stayed home.&#160; But I did make it out there a few times that first summer and several more the next summer.&#160;

And then I had two kids and realized how easy it was to go out there with just a baby as I was now chasing a toddler and pushing a baby.&#160; 

Hmmm no pictures of the sailing watching in 2006…must have been too busy juggling two.&#160; Here is one of the two shortly before they became three.

Once I had two toddlers walking around we moved from our spot on the bridge, to a spot with more room to run while we waited for Daddy to sail by. 

Funny thing is that when I had our third child we found ourselves out cheering Daddy on more Wednesdays than not.&#160; [![baby wearing](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_3636.jpg "baby wearing")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_3636.jpg)

And as the kids grew bigger they really began to love it.&#160; [![waiting for Daddy](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/019.jpg "waiting for Daddy")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/019.jpg)

They&#160; get so excited when they spot his boat in the distance.&#160; They start screaming and jumping and dancing.&#160;&#160;&#160;

Tonight they started talking about how they can’t wait till they grow up enough to go out and race on the boat with Daddy.&#160; (I know that’ll be a dream come true for Daddy too).
