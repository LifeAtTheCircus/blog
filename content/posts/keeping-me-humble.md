I was feeling pretty good about myself this week.&#160; Got a little boost of energy with week 12 and began to tame this household which I had slacked off on over the first trimester.&#160; Finally, I can leave the guest bedroom door open as well as the master bed room.&#160;&#160; I even cleaned out the van which had reached its [height of total messiness](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/28/keep-it-real-check-out-my-wheels/), threw away all that trash crammed in around the car seats and brought in the plethora of coats and shoes which were strewn all over the floor.&#160; This was also the week of the harvest party at our tutorial, which me and another mom were in charge of.&#160; I spent all day Wednesday at the tutorial setting up, running, and cleaning up after the harvest party.&#160; And yet I even got all, yes [ALL, of the laundry washed](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/13/the-bane-of-my-existence/) and just two baskets left to fold and put away.&#160; And this was the week, [Scott was out of town](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/11/19/hes-baaaack/) for 3 days/nights on business.&#160;&#160; 

Yes, I was feeling pretty darn good about my week.&#160; 

And then I picked my son up from Sunday School. 

Funny how something so simple can take you down a notch or two. 

The teacher greeted me with a smile on her face and said, “I have got to tell you what your son said today.&#160; He always says the funniest things.”&#160; 

Uh-oh, I thought.&#160; I’ve worked with children enough to know that this will not end well for the parents.

Nice.&#160; 

What I failed to mention is that last night I was feeling quite sick.&#160; Got home from the end of season soccer party with a killer headache and nausea.&#160; Scott had to go to the homeless ministry, so I sat on the couch with a bowl on my lap and let the kids watch cartoons as I dozed and snuggled with them.&#160; 

How sad that a weeks worth of hard work can be completely forgotten because of one evening of slacking on the couch.&#160;
