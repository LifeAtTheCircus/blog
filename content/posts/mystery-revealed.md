What were my kids doing on the quilt in [that picture yesterday?](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/07/01/what-is-going-on-here/)&#160; Were they tracking an escaped ant from their ant farm? Were they studying the quilt pattern in preparation for making one of their own?&#160; Were they praying over their baby brother?

Not quite

Believe it or not, underneath that pile of circus cast members was our youngest child…

We were attempting some tummy time, but I don’t think the poor guy had any room to lift his little head with all the 
smothering
 encouragement from his older siblings.&#160; 

So instead he laid his precious little head down on the quilt and fell asleep.
