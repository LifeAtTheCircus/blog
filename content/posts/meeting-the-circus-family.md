Our son was born at 10:27pm.&#160; Unfortunately, because he was born so late, his brother and sisters didn’t get to meet him until the next morning.&#160; We loved the first night with him but it felt like the birthing process was somehow incomplete until we were all together.&#160;

When I told them his name, my son’s face light up as it registered that he got the baby brother he was longing for.&#160; He said to me “Mom, I am so excited that he is a boy!”&#160; Me too, I replied.&#160; “But Mom, you said you would be excited about a boy or a girl.”&#160; “Right,” I said, “and I would have been… you said the same thing.”&#160; “Yea,” he answered, “But I REEAALLLLY wanted a boy!” [![IMG_8897](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_88971.jpg "IMG_8897")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_88971.jpg)Doesn’t that look on his face say it all?&#160; 

He wasn’t the only one instantly smitten though.&#160; The girls were truly taken by their baby brother.&#160; They wanted to touch his toes, and count his fingers.&#160;&#160;&#160;

And the baby of the family, is no longer the baby… she cherishes her role as big sister.&#160; Her face lights up with joy every time she gets to hold him.&#160; 

As the kids left the hospital a few hours later, I couldn’t help but smile as my heart was very full.&#160; Our family is now complete.&#160; And I couldn’t be happier.&#160; Funny how things changed in a mere matter of hours. 

Here we are as we dropped the kids off on our way to the hospital.&#160; Doesn't this picture already strike you as so incomplete?
