A few moments from this weekend which I wish to savor…

1.&#160; My son presenting his gift to his extended family.&#160; (One nap time he came up excited to share that he had drawn a picture from each scene in Luke 2.&#160; On Christmas he gave one picture to each person.&#160; He then laid them all out on the floor and recited the story from memory.)

2.&#160; Prepping the Christmas Lasagnas with my daughter… it marked a milestone, in which she was truly helpful in the kitchen.&#160; She made one lasagna and I made the other!

3.&#160; Uncle Jim patiently spending time reading and playing with my kids. ( sooo good to have him here rather than skyping from Iraq like last year)

I am so thankful for the memories shared this past weekend.&#160; They are worth far more to me than anything that could have been wrapped and put under our tree.
