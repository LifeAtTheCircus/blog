I got my love of sports from my dad.&#160; I can remember watching Pirates games at 5 when he was out of town, just to make me feel closer to him.&#160; In high school, my dad would take me to Penn State Football games to watch my cousin play in the Blue Band.&#160; I think my dad made sure that we attended every kind of professional sporting event at least once.&#160;&#160; He took us to Orioles games, a Capitals game, a Bullets game and once we even attended a preseason Redskins/Steelers game.&#160; While most kids were learning their states and capitals, my dad was quizzing me on cities and sports team.&#160;&#160; He’d name a city and I’d name the professional football and baseball teams from that city.&#160; 

I saw a baby bib this weekend that said, “I was born a Steelers fan.”&#160; Though I am bit big for a bib, this most definitely describes me.&#160; 

Dad taught me lots about sports, but without a doubt, my love for the Steelers is the biggest sports heritage he passed on to me.&#160; Even though I was raised in the Baltimore area, there was no doubt, no question who our family routed for.&#160; I can remember Dad telling me about Jerome Bettis “See that guy there, number 36… they call him the Bus b/c when people try to tackle him he just keeps running, taking them with him for the ride.”

When my family moved back to PA and I transferred to Grove City College, I was finally able to watch the Steelers weekly.&#160; I’d leave the lunch hall early on Sun afternoon to go up to my room and cheer for my boys in black and gold.&#160;&#160; Then Dad and I would discuss the game on the phone afterwards.&#160; 

When Scott and I married and moved to MD, my dad would tape the Steelers game for us and mail us the VHS tapes to watch… for a few seasons Wednesday nights were football nights at our house.&#160; We’d always try to schedule a few trips to my parents in the fall so we could watch the games with my folks.&#160; New traditions were formed as we started meeting them in Ligonier in August to watch the team at training camp.&#160; My parents also make sure to keep my kids dressed in Steelers apparel each season.&#160;

This weekend, the circus fam headed to PA to make good on that promise.&#160; 

I don’t often get much one on one time with my dad.&#160; Typically the kids are vying for Grandma and Papa’s attention when we get together and if I do occasionally sneak off for some one on one time with a parents, it is usually my mom.&#160;

To be honest, perhaps it wasn’t the most fair gift to give my dad.&#160; Because I enjoyed the time together, just as much, if not more than my dad.&#160; In a lot of ways, it was a gift to myself as well.&#160; Watching the Steelers play in that atmosphere was was a ton of fun; watching it with my dad, was priceless!&#160; Thanks dad for not only sharing your love of Steelers football with me, but for sharing your Christmas gift as well.&#160;
