Momnesia

Mushy brain

Call it what you will, but I am sorry this circus mom has nothing to give ya.&#160; I’ve sat down and started posts 3 separate times this week only to stop half way through.&#160; I wanted to fill you in on our hamster wheel paced life the past few weeks but when I write it all out it just seems boring.&#160; Really, do you want to hear about the circus family’s daily routine?&#160; Yea… I didn’t think so.&#160; 

Then I started to post pictures from our trip to the county fair.&#160; But, I noticed that my last several posts have all been pictorial in nature and was afraid it would seem to journalistic.&#160; 

So I stopped.&#160; 

But I really can’t go yet one more day with the same post sitting up there begging to be commented on.&#160; 

It’s 3:00 on Friday.&#160; There is 30 min left in our afternoon quiet/nap time and I have 3 baskets of laundry to fold, a kitchen to tidy,&#160; an apple pie I promised the kids we’d bake on Wednesday that I am really hoping we get to today, bathroom floor to scrub, guest bed room to tidy and a little schoolwork left to be finished.&#160;&#160; I’d also like to clean out the minivan b/c it is a complete disaster again and I hate looking at it like that.&#160; But I know that will get bumped to 
next week
 never never land. 

I am afraid the elusive, clever post I keep hoping to come up with will have to wait yet again. 

So, help this momma out.&#160; (if your even still checking the ol blog)

What do you wanna hear about?

*our Talk Like a Pirate Dinner (which we celebrated a day late b/c I got the date wrong for International Talk Like a Pirate Day)

*our annual trip to the county fair

*first day of school pictures

*my new found love of coffee

*my sewing class

Perhaps next week I can collect my thoughts and write about one or more of the above topics. 

Until then, Happy Friday!
