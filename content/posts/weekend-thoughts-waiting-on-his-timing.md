My son recently discovered the term “Summer Vacation” and in the innocence that only youth gives, he was quite disheartened when he learned that preschool didn’t last all summer long.  

The fact that he’ll be in Kindergarten and not returning to his preschool didn’t help the matter.  

It’s been so fun to watch him grow this past year at preschool.  When we were looking at school’s last spring, I wasn’t sure where we wanted to send him.  I had narrowed it down to two school’s and I’ll be honest, this one wasn’t my top choice.  But the top choice only had availabilities in the afternoon and I was not AT ALL interested in interrupting the girls nap time for preschool pick up.  

So, the answer became very clear.  

And I knew from orientation, that this school was a perfect fit for us.   I have been so pleased with the teachers and the administration and have had a truly positive experience for us all.  Even the girls have enjoyed participating in various family events at the school and are looking forward to their chance to attend in a few years.  

But when school started, my son wasn’t so sure about things.  He didn’t want new friends b/c he informed me, he already had friends.  And he wasn’t excited about being away from the girls and I all morning.    He has loved it.  He has made new friends and gained some independence.  And today he stayed for lunch bunch for the first time all year.  (Lunch Bunch is an optional hour that the kids can stay after school to eat lunch with their friends).  Before now when sign ups came home each month, he always told me he didn’t want to go b/c he really wanted to eat lunch with me and the girls :-) .  I saw no reason to push him into it.  This week he informed me that he changed his mind and he wanted to stay on Friday.  

I share all of this b/c here it is spring and here we are one year later facing uncertainty about next fall.  Scott and I have spent a lot of time visiting, researching, discussing, observing, praying and thinking about how we plan to educate our son next year. We narrowed it down to either our local public school or homeschooling using a tutorial.  

There are lots of things I like about our local public school (we live in a good school district) and I am not ruling it out for first grade, but, our state has mandatory full day kindergarten, which I am not a fan of.   So, we decided that for kindergarten, we are going to try home schooling with the tutorial.    He’ll attend the tutorial 2 days a week from 8:30-1:30.  He’ll have a tutor (aka teacher) who will set the pace and assign lessons.  He’ll have classmates and recess and lunch.  He’ll have someone else besides his parents evaluating him.  But, I will get to be his primary educator and I am nervously excited about using my teaching degree with my own children.  3 days a week his classroom will be in our dining room.  The tutorial is important though because we really think our sons temperament will benefit from the two days out of the house and, to be honest, I really need the accountability it provides for me.  

It seems like the perfect answer for our family.  Applications were accepted starting March 1 and Scott drove our application to the post office to make sure it arrived on time.  

We went in for the interview and student testing and both went wonderfully.  

I received a call this week from the director and learned that our son is on the waiting list for their kindergarten class.  

What???   Waiting list?  That wasn’t part of our plan.  

They are considering opening up two classes as they have enough applications and the board will meet this month to discuss that option.  She told me she has never had to turn someone away…God always works things out.  

So, this isn’t a shut door by any stretch.  

But it isn’t wide open either.  

And so we wait. And pray.  And seek God’s direction for next fall.  

I take great comfort in the fact that we like both options.  I take even greater comfort in the fact that I know that my son will be exactly where God wants him to be in the fall.  Be it hopping on the big yellow bus to take him to our local public school, or riding in the minivan to the tutorial.  

Selfishly, I want to know now where he will go.  I want the time for me and my son to mentally prepare for whatever this new step will be.  If I am homeschooling, I have a lot to get in order and prepare for.  If I am sending him off to school all day, I have a lot to emotionally prepare for.  

But, I know that God will let me know, when I need to do know.  And not a moment sooner.  

And so I wait.  

_Got a weekend thought you want to share with the rest of us?  How about a post from this week that was thought provoking in nature?  Make my day and link it up below.  It’s my first time hosting a carnival and I’d love to read your thoughts.  Or, if your not ready (or don't have a blog), please don't hesitate to leave a comment.   You can share a thought on my post, or on something you’ve been thinking/learning about lately.  I look forward to reading what you have to share._

  

Did any of you notice that this post is a partial answer to [the two questions] (http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/13/still-more-questions-than-answers/)I posted about a few months ago?  Yea, we haven't decided about the other one yet.
