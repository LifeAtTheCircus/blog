There is a huge pile of bamboo in our backyard waiting for a run to the dump on Saturday.&#160; Until then, it provided the perfect landscape for my son to build a fort and play war.&#160; He stayed out there for hours and was so proud of his camouflage.&#160;

Unfortunatly, his gun kinda gives him away. 

When I showed this picture to my husband I said it should be called, 

“Be [

But my son piped up, I was not hunting rabbits Mom, I was warring.&#160; (who knew war could be a verb)?



This just might be my fav of the afternoon spent in the bamboo pile.&#160; Every soldier needs a good buddy.&#160;
