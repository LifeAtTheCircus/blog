My son loves baseball.&#160; 

   


I am not sure exactly where this love comes from since his dad and I are both avid football fans, but could care less about baseball.&#160; Didn’t even watch the World Series.&#160; In fact, the only baseball I’ve watched over the past few years, I’ve watched with my son.&#160; As a 2 year old, he would ask for it on TV and we’d sit and watch several innings on ESPN or catch a little on Sports Center.&#160; 

When he turned two, his aunt Karen and Uncle Jim sent him a tee ball stand for his birthday.&#160; Perhaps that is where his love was born.[![IMG_1493](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img-1493-thumb.jpg "IMG_1493")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img-1493.jpg)

Can you believe it was once acceptable practice in our house to play baseball indoors?&#160; This shot was taken in our living room and as memory recalls, this was not an isolated incident.&#160;

So, he was beyond excited when the Superbowl came and went b/c now that football season was over, he could start looking forward to baseball.&#160; And this year is his first year playing on a team.&#160; 

I will never forget the look on his face as he got ready for practice.&#160; He was downstairs and ready to go when Scott got home.&#160; He was so eager to get going Scott assumed they were running late and quickly they jetted off to practice.&#160; Scott called me a few minutes later confused as to where everyone was. 

They were 15 min early.

My little guy had a grin on his face the entire practice.&#160; It was so cute to watch him stretching, grinning from ear to ear.&#160; He was stretching for baseball. Does it get better than that his face seemed to say?

And yes, we were THOSE parents taking pictures of our kid stretching at baseball practice.&#160;

I am so excited about his first baseball season.&#160; I can’t imagine enjoying any game more than his first ever real baseball game.&#160; I can’t believe my little guy has grown from hitting the ball in the living room to stretching at the Little League park.&#160; 

He just might make a baseball fan out of me yet!
