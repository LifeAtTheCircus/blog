 1.&#160; Two rakes and three kids does not make for a happy equation.[![IMG_3333](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3333.jpg "IMG_3333")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3333.jpg) 2.&#160; Make sure your kids have their shoes securely tied before you begin raking.&#160; Otherwise you could rake a pile like this only to have your son tell you it was time to go on a “treasure hunt” to find his missing shoes in said pile.

3.&#160; If your going to jump into the pile with the kids, don’t wear baggy jeans.&#160; Otherwise you will find leaves in your underwear when you go inside. [](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3334.jpg)

5.&#160; Always, always have your camera ready when raking leaves.&#160; You never know when you’re gonna capture that&#160; expression that you wanna hold onto forever.&#160;
