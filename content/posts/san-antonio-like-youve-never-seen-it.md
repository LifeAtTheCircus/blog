After 4 days of camping at both [Guadalupe](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/13/oh-so-you-wanted-to-see-the-actual-parks/) and [Big Bend](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/14/big-bend-from-sunup-to-sundown/) NP, the next big destination on our trip was to San Antonio.&#160; We were quite excited about showers, and more room to spread out.&#160; After checking into our hotel at noon, we were off to see the sights.

Where to first?&#160; The Alamo? The Children’s Museum?&#160; The River walk?&#160; So many choices…

We thought what better place to go to really experience the city than the urgent care clinic.&#160; And it was a mere two blocks away from our hotel!!&#160; How perfect!&#160; So without stopping even for lunch, we quickly set out for our destination!

We were greeted by a kind and friendly staff who told us we could stay in the waiting room for 1.5 hrs before seeing the Dr.&#160; How delightful!&#160; After spending the day before strapped into their car seats, the kids were so excited to get to sit quietly and wait in a waiting room.&#160;&#160; 

We got to wait in not one, but two waiting rooms as part way through our wait, they sent us to a doctor office next door.&#160; This way more people in this lovely city got to experience Life At The Circus.&#160; [![IMG_6607](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/img-6607-thumb.jpg "IMG_6607")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/img-6607.jpg)&#160;

At a little after 3 we were shown into our room.&#160; Have no fear about us not getting to see the city.&#160; We got to see the city from our very own waiting room!&#160;

Eventually the doctor came in and checked all 3 children’s ears.&#160;

The kids were just loving San Antonio at this point.&#160; And Mom and Dad were so glad that we scheduled in this day of fun to recover and refresh after our week of camping.&#160; 

After lunch/dinner in the food court, we set off to see the Alamo before it closed at 5:30.&#160; We were able to squeeze in a quick tour, during which our youngest fell asleep on her daddy’s shoulders.&#160; We then headed back to the hotel for a little rest and nebulizer treatment before figuring out how to top of such an exciting day!&#160;
