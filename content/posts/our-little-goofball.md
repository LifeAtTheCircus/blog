I love my son's imagination.  He can turn a cooking pot into a race car or become a dog by merely wearing his shoes on his hands.  Here are a few pictures of his antics from this morning.  They made me smile and I hope they do the same for you!

When I heard these words, they brought a different image to mind.

Here he is walking like a dog... Don't you just love how the pants are on backwards... quite a fashion sense, don't ya think?
