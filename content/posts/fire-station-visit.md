Our local fire station had an open house this morning and we took the kids.

I always appreciate the demo they do where they have a fireman get into his full uniform and mask so that the kids know in the even of a fire to go towards them, not hide away from them.

In addition to climbing on the trucks and sitting inside they had several educational experiences for them.

They had a fire prevention truck and a 9-1-1 practice station.  They seem like little things, but I felt like it was good practice and review for even my older kids and I was grateful for the opportunity.

They also really enjoyed trying on the gear.  Shhhhâ€¦.. I think even the big kids enjoyed that part too.
