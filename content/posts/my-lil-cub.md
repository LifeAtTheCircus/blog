I had no idea that in just 6 short years he’d be at Cup Scout camp with Daddy learning a whole slew of new things.&#160; [![IMG_0035](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG_0035.jpg "IMG_0035")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG_0035.jpg)

I was so excited for my son and my husband yesterday as they got to spend the day together at camp.

It’s been so fun to watch their bond grow over the past 6 years.[![snuggling with Daddy](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/snugglingwithDaddy.jpg "snuggling with Daddy")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/snugglingwithDaddy.jpg)
