 After posting the very real life pictures of the inside of my van [last week](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/28/keep-it-real-check-out-my-wheels/), I wanted to show you all how _very_ different it looks now.  :-)   Wanna know the secret for my successful transformation?   Friday was my son's first day of preschool and at his school the teachers and administrators come to your vehicle to get your kid out in the morning and drop him off at pick up.   [This](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/28/keep-it-real-check-out-my-wheels/) was not the impression I wanted to leave with my son's preschool.   So Thursday morning I was out cleaning and vacuuming the van.  

Check out the new look.

See the bag hanging there?  It's my van diaper bag... has diapers, wipes, antibacterial wipes, paper towels, sunscreen, bug spray.

OK, I am really excited about this new little trick.  We took a box and hubby wrapped it with fun paper.  The kids keep all their toys in it.  And they know that before they leave the van, all toys get picked up off the floor and put in the box. (It's been 5 days and so far they've been keeping up with it)!

OK, look closer at the front seat.  Nice, huh?

And the bags have been taken in from the back seat.   I can't fit much more than the double stroller back there.  I do have some plates to return to church tonight from my MOPS cookout, which will remove the last of the clutter.  

So, that was my tackle this week.  And I gotta say, it makes me smile each time I open the door to the van, even if the kids are fighting over whose turn it is to open the door.
