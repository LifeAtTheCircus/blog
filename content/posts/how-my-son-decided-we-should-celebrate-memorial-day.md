I’ll be honest.&#160; When I think Memorial Day celebration, I typically think cook outs and swimming pools.&#160; This year being 9 mths preggo, we didn’t really make any big plans for Memorial Day weekend.&#160;&#160; Scott grilled for us several times and even got out this smoker and cooked a chicken for Monday’s dinner.&#160; We went to the park, did a few things around the house and basically took it easy all weekend.&#160; It was perfect.&#160; 

So, my plans for Monday included sleeping in, eating sticky buns, perhaps a trip to Target in there somewhere and smoked chicken for dinner. 

Then, I talked with my 6 yr old son.

So, we did just that.

This weekend my family enjoyed a peaceful weekend at home.&#160; We went to nearby parks and enjoyed the swings, kicked the soccer ball in the field and played catch.&#160; Many families might of done the same thing this weekend, only without their entire family with them to enjoy the event.&#160; Many families sacrificed their husbands, wives, sons, or daughters so that my family and yours could enjoy such freedom.&#160;&#160; As we played at the park, I never feared for our safety.&#160; I didn’t have to look over my shoulder.&#160; This is thanks to the soldiers that fought for our safety.&#160;&#160; On Sunday we went to church.&#160; The church of our choosing to worship in the manner we chose.&#160;&#160; We were able to do this thanks to the freedoms our soldiers fought so bravely to defend.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

&#160; I am so thankful for the country I live in and the freedoms we enjoy.&#160; And I am so thankful my son reminded us to take the time to pause and think of the soldiers who gave those gifts to us.&#160; It was a great way to celebrate Memorial Day.
