So many things I want to remember from this stage of life…the sweet way she mispronounces her baby brother’s name…. and the way his face lights up with recognition when I walk in a room…the raspy way she belts out songs in the back seat, and the sweet way he kisses his sisters goodbye before heading into school… I know I think I’ll never forget and yet those who’ve gone before me say I will.&#160; 

So this week I jotted down a few of their one liners that made me smile. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3 year old:&#160; Mama we’re playing **“hide and go to seeker”**&#160; (I also love the way she told me the rules of the game as if it was a new game her brother and sister invented just for them)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gave my 6 yr old his first spelling test last week.&#160; When I was explaining how spelling tests worked, he asked, **“Am I allowed to think about it or do I have to just write it down?”&#160;** (I assured him he was allowed to think during spelling tests)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was working with my 4 yr old on writing the letter N for handwriting.&#160; She asked if this was “English”?&#160; When I told her yes, she was SO excited that she wrote in English.&#160; I am not sure what language she thought she’d been writing in all this time.&#160; 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was busily working on cleaning the house for company last week.&#160;&#160; My son asked why I was working so hard to clean.&#160; When I explained that we had company coming, he said, “Will they not want to come back if it is dirty?”&#160; No, I replied, “But I like for people to see our house looking nice and know that we take good care of our home.”&#160; He said, “But Mom, that would be a lie.”&#160; ….._mother grumbles wearily with frustration to herself….._&#160;

I love how eager she always is to help me in the kitchen.&#160; If I am working in the kitchen, you can bet she’ll be by my side asking to help.&#160; Something tells me this may fade with time and so I try to remember to cherish the “help” while she is eager to offer it even if it takes longer and makes more of a mess.&#160; (Some days I forget this and shoo her away so I can just get it done… but I know I will miss my eager little helper when she grows).
