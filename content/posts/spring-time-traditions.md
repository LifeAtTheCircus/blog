For the past 3 years the kids and I have gone to a local strawberry farm to pick our own berries.&#160; It is a tradition I cherish.&#160;

We are suburbanites.&#160; We don’t even really garden.&#160; But, I love for my children to get some real life farm experiences.&#160; I love for them to walk down the rows upon rows of plants.

This year my son really went to town.&#160;&#160; He’d scamper ahead down the row and come back with a basket overflowing with red berries.&#160;&#160; He didn’t want to stop, _“Please mom just one more basket!”_

I love the joy and satisfaction they get from “working the land” themselves.

I love taking the kids to pick our own produce because we always come home with so much more than just delicious, fresh, produce, but with life lessons and timeless memories as well.&#160;
