His favorite thing these days is Choo Choos.&#160; He was so excited at Target the other day when we went down the Thomas aisle.&#160; “Choo Choo right there”&#160; he pointed excitedly, over and over.&#160;

He always sleeps with at least one choo choo in his hand and is super thrilled with the choo choo mattress sheet his Grandma made for him.&#160; He also LOVES to wear his choo choo shirt, or bathing suit.&#160; And is thrilled with his choo choo book from the library.&#160; He literally jumps up and down if the kids turn Thomas on the tv.&#160; He will point over and over “Look choo-choo!”&#160; “Choo Choo right there!”

It’s so fun for me to see him enjoy something all his own.&#160; He fell in love with trains on his own right, not because his brother or sisters liked it and it’s really the first thing he’s latched on to like that.&#160;

I love seeing him grow into a little person with his own likes/dislikes/opinions/passions.
