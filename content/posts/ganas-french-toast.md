[![Nana and Me](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/NanaandMe.jpg "Nana and Me")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/NanaandMe.jpg)I love my husband’s Nana.&#160;&#160; She’s a remarkable lady.&#160;&#160; I loved her for years, just based on hearing about her from her grandson and reading her sweet letters.&#160; Then, I flew to California and met her.&#160; And I loved her as my own Nana!!&#160; 

When I walked in her side door, I instantly felt at home.&#160; I sat down at her table and never wanted to leave again. 

 Gana (as my kids call her b/c she is their Great Nana) is famous for her quince jam, her tacos, and her French toast (among many other things).

Being a mother of three boys, she is used to making food in bulk.&#160; And her method of making French toast totally [works for me](http://www.wearethatfamily.com)!

Then a few years ago my in laws gave me a large waffle iron.&#160; I squealed with delight, “Now I can make French toast like Nana!”&#160; 

Yes, Gana’s secret for French toast is to cook it in one of those large waffle irons (not those tiny circular single serving Belgium waffles irons).&#160; The waffle iron seems to seal in the taste in the bread and I love the fact that I can cook 4 at a time.&#160;

It might not look like your average French toast… it def looks like a cross between a waffle and French toast.&#160;&#160; Call it waffle toast…or French waffles…or toasted waffles…whatever you call it, call it breakfast…because it is delicious!&#160;&#160; I’m telling you, it’s tasty, more healthy, and definitely quicker than my old method.&#160; It’s worth a try, I promise you!
