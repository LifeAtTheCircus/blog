With spring like weather finally here, we've been spending some more time outside.  I took these series of pictures of the kids out on our deck.  Note the sequence of events.  


Baby is playing cutely in boat so Mommy decides to take a picture.

Big Sister notices and has to get in on the action and spotlight.

My kids have been fascinated with my pots and pans using them for a variety of purposes... to pretend cook, to drive boats, as masks, as hats, as steering wheels for cars... I have found them in the couch cushions, in my sons bed, in the toy room, on the deck...  
Oddly, I never seem to find them in my kitchen cabinet.
