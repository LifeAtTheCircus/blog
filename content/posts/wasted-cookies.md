Nothing like the holidays, to bring on some humor from the lil ones.&#160; Here’s a few I want to record for posterity.

When Scott was talking to my 4 yr old about what she wanted to get me for Christmas, she told him she wanted to get Mommy flowers and she was going to be nice.&#160; To clarify Scott asked, “So your going to be nice as a Christmas gift for Mommy?”&#160; When she affirmed this, he told her that she didn’t have to wait until Christmas to be nice.&#160; She could start then.&#160; She then answered, _“Oh no Daddy, I don’t want to give away the surprise!”_

On Christmas Eve my son came up to me and asked if we had to give Santa the “shape cookies” (meaning the ones we cut out with cutters and decorated)&#160; I told him that Santa would be happy with any cookie they left for him.&#160; He then whispered to me so the girls couldn’t hear, _“Good, b/c since I know it’s just you and Dad that eat them, I don’t want to waste them on you.”_
