Its funny to me how many “old sayings” run through my head on any given day. 

For example, “Don’t cry over spilled milk.”&#160; I must repeat that to myself at least twice a week... “Don’t cry over spilled milk… DON’T CRY over spilled milk… (and in my head I also add quite often, 
don’t make anyone else cry
 over spilled milk.”

So, I had to laugh when my son and I were doing science this afternoon and we were talking about the various states of water.&#160; He already has a pretty good grasp of solid, liquid, and gas (especially pertaining to water) but anything with the word experiment after it gets him down right giddy.&#160; So we were making steam as part of our science lesson today.

And I couldn’t help but laugh (and snap a picture) when I answered the phone and turned around to see this.&#160; I figured we’d go work on something else at the table while we waited for the water to boil.&#160;&#160; He seemed quite content to sit and wait for it to turn to steam. 

I then told him that “a watched pot never boils.”&#160; To which he responded, “What’s a watched pot?” 

We read for a few more minutes and then…

He asked if this was in the book too… it wasn’t.&#160; But, what’s the fun of home schooling if you can’t add a little chocolate and marshmallows now and then, right?&#160; So, we sipped some hot chocolate while doing our math and I thought to myself, how lucky can I be?
