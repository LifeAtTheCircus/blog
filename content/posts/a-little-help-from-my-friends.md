Yesterday when I was taking a picture of my son with his [“baby”](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/03/16/baby-im-yours/) to post on the blog, he asked what I was going to do with the picture.&#160; 
  > Son: “Are you going to send it away to people?”
> 
> Me: No, I’m just putting it on my blog.&#160; 
> 
> Son: But I want this picture for my scrapbook.
> 
> Me: That’s fine, you can still have the picture, they’re not taking it, just looking at it.
> 
> Son: Do you know the people that see your blog? 
> 
> Me: Not all of them.
> 
> Son: Then why are you putting this picture on there?
> 
> Me: Because I want to tell them about how happy we are to find baby.
> 
> Son: Did they know baby was missing?
> 
> Me: No
> 
> Son: Then why are you telling them?&#160;

Ah, the dear boy has stumbled upon one of the mysteries of blogging… _who are these people visiting my site?&#160; Why do they care about our life?_&#160; I’ve been blogging for almost a year now and I don’t have these answers exactly figured out.&#160; But I do know that since starting my blog last spring, I’ve had the rare opportunity to share my life with people I otherwise may not have met and in doing so have formed some friendships with people both near and far, for which I am immensely grateful.

In honor of my blogoversary coming next week and as a belated birthday present, my dear husband is doing a blog redesign for me.&#160; New format, new header, all sorts of new features.&#160; I am so excited about it!&#160; As we are working on this, I am wondering if you, dear readers, could lend us a hand?&#160; 

We are updating my favorite acts link, and I am just wondering if those of you who read faithfully would mind letting me know which post or posts stick out in your mind as favorites?
