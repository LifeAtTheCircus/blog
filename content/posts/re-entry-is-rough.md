While our world wind trip to and from Florida went off really without a hitch, the 48 hrs since pulling into our driveway have been anything but smooth sailing.

Allow me to complain…&#160; 

We got home at 9pm on Sunday night… we unloaded what we had to, put the kids to bed and sat on the couch.&#160; 

Monday morning was back to reality… Scott had to be at work at 8, and the oldest two had to be at church at 8:45 for VBS.&#160; I was so, so tempted to keep them home… and just spend the day in our pjs catching up on laundry and unpacking.&#160;&#160; 

Part of me wishes I had done just that.&#160; But, I took them to church (late of course) then went to pick up our dog from my friends house.&#160; My friend graciously offered to watch the youngest 2 while I went to Aldi to pick up a few things.&#160; I was so excited, going to run a quick errand and then visit with a friend before picking the kids up from church.&#160; 

I don’t shop at Aldi very often.&#160; I think all of my friends do, but me.&#160; Truth is, it’s out of the way, and not convenient so I don’t go.&#160;&#160; But, since I was in the area and kid less, I figured I’d check it out.&#160;&#160; Well, I forgot all about the fact you need a quarter to get your cart… couldn’t find a quarter anywhere in my van… _if only you could pay for your cart with cheerios, then I’d be set_…no problem, this won’t get me down, the kids aren’t with me, I’ll just grab what I can and make more than one trip… _yes, that’s right, my bright idea was to make 4 different trips through Aldi carrying everything_.&#160; Perhaps I should be thankful that after trip one, when the cashier rang me up, I learned the other Aldi rule… they only take cash or debit cards.&#160; And of course I couldn’t remember my pin number to save my life.&#160; 

I left Aldi’s empty handed.&#160; 

Had a great visit with my friend and then back to church for the kids… it is hot and humid… got the kids and finally got them all buckled (_which is not an easy feat with the current car seat configuration that we used for our long car ride_)… more than ready to get home, eat, shower and on with the day… only the car won’t start.&#160; 

Try, try, try some more… same stinkin result. 

The kids and the dog and I waited in the church parking lot for Scott to come and rescue us.&#160;&#160; He is finally able to get it to go and he drives the kids home, while I follow in his car.&#160; He then takes the car to the mechanic.&#160;&#160; I was tired… frustrated… and so ready for a break.&#160; 

When my son prayed that evening, he prayed that tomorrow would be a better day with less fighting.&#160; 

As I talked to my dear friend on the phone, I shared the misery of my day and how bad I felt for taking it out on the kids.&#160; 

She responded, “I didn’t think you yelled at your kids ever.”

_For real?&#160; How is it that my best friend thinks I never yell at my kids?&#160; I have tried to make it my aim in life to be transparent/the real deal.&#160; Seems I have failed at this big time.&#160; So, blogging friends… yes, my kids are a victim of my imperfection and I do yell at my kids.&#160; No, I am not proud of it.&#160; I like to think I don’t do it all the time, but truthfully, I do it more than I’d like to admit._&#160; 

Day 2:&#160; A friend graciously offers to take my kids to VBS for me since I am without a van.&#160; I invite her and her younger 2 to visit after she drops them off.&#160;&#160; This is a new friend whom I just met this spring.&#160; I appreciate her a lot.&#160; Unfortunately, I think every time we have gotten together my house is either messy or my kids are misbehaving.&#160; 

Today, she got to witness both. 

Humbling to say the least. 

This afternoon we head to gymnastics (hooray for having the van back). While my oldest has her class, I take the younger three for Aldi Attempt 2 (_this time I came armed with my quarter and my pin number_).&#160; I left with food and a screaming baby.&#160; After a quick stop at a friends for a little “thinking of you treat” I leave sooner than planned b/c the baby is still screaming (_we’re not in Florida anymore_)…back to gymnastics, hoping to catch the last 15 minutes and visit with my friend in the waiting room, only to head back to the car b/c my kids are misbehaving… _insert more humble pie and a big ol dose of frustration.&#160;_ 

I went home a different route than normal b/c I wanted to pick up sweet corn from the farm stand. 

The stand was closed.&#160; 

And then as my kids are whining about the dinner I had packed for them, the baby is crying again… I suddenly notice the car is making a weird noise AND it seems low on my side… [![download](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/download.jpg "download")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/download.jpg)

Long story short (_yea… this post seems anything but short_), after a few failed attempts, I finally reach Scott, he comes with a cold coke and 2 bags of mini Oreos… he teaches my son how to change a tired and we’re finally home.&#160; 

I know I should be so thankful we didn’t break down on our trip.&#160; Instead I broke down at church.&#160; A safe and comfortable place to get stranded. 

I know I should be so thankful I didn’t get my flat on the side of 95 in the middle of the night.&#160; 

And on one hand I am, truly thankful. 

But, to be honest, on the other hand, I am fed up with this week and can’t believe it’s only Tuesday.&#160;&#160; 

Re-entry has been rough, Wednesday, please be nice to me, kay?
