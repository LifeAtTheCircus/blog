I love my son's imagination! He is at age where I wish I could just freeze time.  He cracks us with his antics these days.  Check out last week's comedy routines.  

My son was playing on the deck when I suddenly heard him say, "Help Mom, I'm stuck."  I turned around to see this.

As I got him out of the basketball net, I asked him what on earth he was doing?  This looked like more than a slam dunk go awry.  He told me he was pretending to be a bug stuck in a web.  Of course, why didn't I think of that?  

On another afternoon he took the spinning top hat off of this little M&amp;M guy he had received for Christmas and put it on his nose announcing that he was now an airplane.

Pretty good don't you think?

He  totally cracked himself up on this one.  I asked him to go get dressed and as he came down the hall I could hear him giggling (I LOVE that sound).

He may not be headed for stand up quite yet, but he definitely knows how to make himself and his family laugh.
