Christmas provides you with many gems...photos which capture the moment, in real life.  Nothing like posing in front of the tree to bring out the true personality of your child.  

Yes... this is def what I meant when I said , "Smile in front of the camera so Mom can have a picture of you in your nice church clothes."

I love this pic... I am entitling it Christmas bliss... I love that it is not posed.. you can see all three kids enjoying their gifts... wrapping paper on the floor and a happy Daddy interacting with this kids.  True gem this photo is...

This one is called "Self Control" as you can tell the kids are all eager to dig into Nana's Christmas tree cinnamon rolls.

Why is it so hard to get a good shot of the family??

And if that isn't hard enough we say, "ok kids now we're going to take another with Nana and Pop..." (Pop so graciously wears his grandson's engineer hat for his little granddaughter and still they don't sit still and smile).

Sometimes the less than perfect candid's truly are my favorite and I know years later when I'm looking back on Christmas pics these treasures will be among my favorite.
