I realized recently, that while I spend lots of time with my kids, too often it's easy for me to spend the day with them, without really playing with them.&#160; So, these past few weeks, I've been doing a lot more playing.&#160; And I gotta say, I'm loving it.

To make it an equal opportunity for all, I did a little hair spiking for my son.&#160; While He did forego the sparkly nails; he gladly spent nail time drawing pictures for the girls to take with them after their time at the salon.&#160; How many beauty salons do you know send you home with hand drawn art work in addition to your up do and mani/petti?&#160;&#160; 

 These pictures were from last week.&#160; This week we bought hot pink polish and a clear/sparkly top coat.&#160; So right now the girls and I are all sporting hot pink and glittery toe nails with just sparkling fingernails.&#160; I'm not usually very good about keeping up with my nails, but perhaps this new form of play, will build in time for me to pretty myself up as well.&#160;&#160; Though I think in the future I might skip the glittery finger nails.

As you can see, we all enjoyed the time of pampering. I think the girls enjoyed the pretty smelling lotion the best.&#160;
