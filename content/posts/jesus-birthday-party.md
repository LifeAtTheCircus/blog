 Last night the kids helped me decorate a birthday cake for Jesus and after singing Him Happy Birthday, followed by a few favorite Christmas carols, we enjoyed cake and ice cream.

Apparently, it is an unwritten rule in our house that when you eat Jesus' birthday cake, you don't need to use silverware.
