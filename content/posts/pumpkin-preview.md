My second born has always been my tactile child.&#160; She loves getting her hands messy… she’s the one who loves the feel of dirt on her skin and apparently is also fond of pumpkin guts on her fingers.&#160; She happily squished and sorted seeds.

Her sister was less thrilled with the feel of pumpkin guts on her hands.
