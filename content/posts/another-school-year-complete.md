 That’s right, today is our last day of school at the building.&#160;

As we prepare to leap into summer… let’s take a quick peek back at day 1.

Look how much they’ve grown&#160; just physically this year!&#160; I can’t believe it’s our last day of Kindergarten, 1st grade, an 3rd grade.

They got to dress down for the last day of school.&#160; _(Can you tell it’s been a chilly spring?)&#160;_ I am so, so, so ready for summer.&#160; And so thankful we all survived and made it to the end of the year!

Our tutors at the tutorial were a true blessing.&#160; They were such a source of encouragement, support, and inspiration to all 4 of us.&#160; And I love, LOVE the community of friends that the kids and I have.&#160; I can’t believe we’ve been a part of that community for 4 whole years now.&#160; My how time is flying!
