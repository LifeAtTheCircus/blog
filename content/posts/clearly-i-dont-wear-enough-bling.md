I was shopping at [BJ's](http://www.bjs.com/) the other day with the kids when we passed the jewelry counter.  

My son asked, &quot;Why is there jewelry at BJ's?&quot;  

I responded, &quot;So people can buy it.&quot;  

He then said, &quot;Yea... I guess if they were getting married and didn't have a ring they could come here.&quot;  

Hmmm.... clearly this Mommy doesn't wear much jewelry, since my son thinks wedding rings are the only kind of jewelry one wears.  It's not that I don't appreciate jewelry.  [I do](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/19/i-got-some-jewelry-this-week/) .   But my morning routine is typically a race.  I put the baby down for her morning nap and the &quot;big kids&quot; get to watch one show from our [TiVo](http://www.tivo.com/) while I take my shower.  I'm racing the clock to get showered and dressed because once the show ends they wonder down the hall and my time is up.   I'm happy to shave my legs and put on deodorant, let alone "accessorize"...  

How about you?  Do you wear jewelry everyday or just on special occasions?
