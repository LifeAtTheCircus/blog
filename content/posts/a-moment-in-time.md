Yesterday afternoon the girls got their baby dolls and strollers and headed to the court to walk their babies.&#160; I don’t know what it was about that particular moment in time, but it struck a chord in this Momma’s heart and made me all sappy.&#160; [![IMG_5119](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_5119.jpg "IMG_5119")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_5119.jpg)

As I watched them pushing their dolls and pretending they were walking to China… with a stop in Tennessee for some Chick-Fil-A, I found myself longing to take in the moment.&#160; I grabbed the camera and was so thankful that they are still little girls.&#160; While they seem to be growing up before my very eyes, they are in fact still 1st and 2nd graders who like to play with baby dolls.&#160; How glad I am for that fact.&#160; And how I long for them to stay that way for awhile.

Then as I snapped pictures and watched them chatting away, I had another thought… “Oh Lord, I prayed, let them be friends forever.”&#160; I hope when they are grown up they will walk their real babies together and chat about life.&#160; I truly hope and pray they are life long friends.&#160; 

And just as I found myself all sentimental over that… the timing couldn’t have been more perfect, because they started pushing their babies down the driveway.

And I got a good chuckle as the baby went flying into the ditch!
