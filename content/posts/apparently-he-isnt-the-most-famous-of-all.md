I got a funny e-mail from my mom this morning.&#160; She told me to set the DVR to record Rudolph tonight b/c apparently my 3 yr old needed a refresher in holiday pop culture.&#160; 

According to my mom…

_“We were walking in the mall on Black Friday.&#160; We went to the Build a Bear shop which had been transformed into Santa's Workshop for Christmas.&#160; They had stuffed snowmen and deer and Santa bears._

_I said to her,&#160; &quot;Look it's Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer!!&quot;_

_To which she looked at me like I just grew 3 heads and said &quot;**A red nose reindeer???&quot;&#160; Really Grandma??”**_

The DVR has been set… wait till she finds out he can fly too!!
