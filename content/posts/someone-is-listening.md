I read an article a few months back that really made me think.&#160; The gist of the article was “Moms, watch the way you talk about your body because 
your body image
 _will shape_ 
your daughters body image
.”&#160; There was more to it than that, but that was gist.&#160; It seemed like wise advice, so I tucked it away. 

And man, I’ve had to practice it a few times and wow is it humbling.&#160; I was changing in the closet with my oldest daughter.&#160; She was picking out my outfit for some reason.&#160; And while changing she looked at my legs and said, “Mom why do your legs jiggle?”&#160; 

hahahaha

Oh boy.&#160;&#160; The article came to mind right away. 

“Well, because my legs aren’t strong there.”&#160; I decided to go with matter of fact truth minus elaborating or apologizing.&#160; She accepted it and we both moved on. 

Last week I started a fitness challenge and part of the challenge required getting weighed and measured at the beginning of the challenge.&#160; My kids were all in the waiting room and when it was time for me to go back and get weighed and measured my 6 year old daughter begged to come. 

OK.&#160; Ladies, we know that stepping on a scale and getting weighed is one of the most humbling things a gal can do.&#160; And I personally don’t like to do it with an audience.&#160; It was humbling enough to do with the totally fit instructor taking my measurements.&#160;&#160; My instinct was no.&#160; But, then that article came to mind and I decided to let her come back. “Sure come on back sweetie.”&#160; She stood and excitedly watched while I stepped on the scale and was measured.&#160; I made no remark about my feelings over the numbers recorded.&#160; And hopefully, she learned that stepping on a scale is not an exercise in self loathing.&#160; 

Anyway, I share these experiences with you because that article really made me think and thought perhaps some of you parents of girls might appreciate that perspective as well.&#160; Our girls are watching and listening to us and I read just today that the number one factor in a girls body image is her mom.&#160; That’s a lot of pressure, but you know what, it is also a lot of power.&#160; I remember when I was in high school, I wanted to go on a diet.&#160; I wasn’t super fat or anything, but wanted to be skinnier.&#160; My mom took me to weight watchers.&#160; She said, “If you want to lose weight, there is a healthy way to do it.”&#160; Not with fad diets like the cabbage diet I remember my friends all doing.&#160; I learned to journal my food, to make sure to eat healthy options from all food groups.&#160; It might sound extreme going to weight watchers to lose 5 pounds, but you know what, it truly shaped my viewpoint on dieting.&#160; Even now, 20 years later, if I want to lose a little weight, I go back to that discipline of food journaling and eating more fruits and veggies and less carbs and sugar.&#160;&#160; I start exercising and drinking more water.&#160; Because I remember it is more healthy and effective to make lifestyle changes over short term fad diets.&#160; I really think my moms input and modeling shaped my perspective.&#160; And I hope I can have a similar effect on my own girls as they grow.&#160; Above all, I hope they remember and take to heart the verse we put on their wall…
