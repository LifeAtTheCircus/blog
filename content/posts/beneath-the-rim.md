The highlight of our day at the Grand Canyon for most of the members of our circus crew was a short hike they took into the canyon.&#160;&#160;

We all started on the hike, but it was more than this “fraid’ of heights Momma” could handle.&#160;&#160; 

The plan was to go to the first tunnel and back, but after about 2 treks on the switchback, I was biting back tears and hating EVERY second of it.&#160; Scott suggested I head back to the top with our three year old and I IMMEDIATELY agreed (you know… for my sons safety ;-).&#160;&#160; I hate letting fear get the best of me and I hate missing out on things, but I also knew my nerves had been pushed to their limit and we still had several more hours to go at the park and all I was doing was ruining it for the others.&#160;

So, my little man and I headed out.&#160; He was not happy with me, because he too hated missing out on what the rest were doing.&#160; But, once I found a bird for him to chase on the top, he was fine.&#160; He chased birds and we rocked in rocking chairs and about 45 minutes or so later the rest of the crew joined us at the top.&#160; ALL SMILES.&#160; _And I whispered a prayer of thanksgiving._&#160; 

They had the time of their life.

If I had gone, we’d never have gotten this precious picture.

Sometimes, I think it’s awesome to push past your fears and not let them limit you.&#160; And other times, it’s equally important to know your limitations.&#160; This vacation I’ve had to do both.&#160;
