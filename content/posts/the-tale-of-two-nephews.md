About 7 months ago we received a phone call that we’d been hoping for, for several years now.&#160; My [sister in law](http://anotherstelladay.blogspot.com/) (Scott’s sister) was pregnant!&#160; And there was much rejoicing and squealing at the circus house.&#160; Later that same week, we learned that my other [sister in law](http://mutheringheights.blogspot.com/2009/07/juggling.html) (my brother’s wife) was also expecting a baby!&#160; Their due dates were within 2 weeks of each other.&#160; And a few months later we found out that they were both expecting boys.

There was much rejoicing and dreaming of blue at the circus house as we anticipated our new nephews and cousins!

Well, 2 weeks ago we got the call from my brother that his wife’s water had broken and they were on the way to the hospital.&#160; The next morning the circus crew took a day trip to meet our new little nephew.&#160; The kids were so excited to see their little cousin, only hours old.

After watching everyone take turns holding him, my youngest went over to the sink to wash her hands.&#160; She then proclaimed, “my turn to hold the baby.”&#160; We had to explain that even though she washed her hands, she was not old enough to hold her baby cousin and would instead have to stick with watching while holding her baby doll.&#160; (given the gentle and loving way with which she was holding her doll, I don’t know why we didn’t just pass him off to her).

It was such a joy to be able to hold him and welcome him into the family. 

Now, we are very eagerly awaiting the phone call from El Paso, letting us know when our next nephew is making his debut!&#160; I am hoping it is soon as I can’t wait to meet him and I am sure my dear SIL is tired of being 9 months pregnant in the 105 degree Texas heat.&#160; 

And yes, these beautiful bundles of blue, sure make it hard on the circus Mommy as her baby has outgrown her need for a crib and now changing table!&#160; With all 3 walking, talking and wearing underwear, I officially don’t have a baby or even a toddler anymore at the circus!
