While we’re making him wait till the end of the month to savor his first taste of cake (at his party when his grandparents can be there to ooh and aah), we couldn’t let his day go by without some sort of yummy mess.&#160; 

Enter baby’s first donut for breakfast.

First, he ate each individual sprinkle off of the donut.&#160; [![IMG_1464](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_1464.jpg "IMG_1464")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_1464.jpg)

Then, it was time to ditch the hat, and tack a dab at the icing… again using his fingers to scrape it clean.

Next, it was time to dig into the donut itself.

Hey Mom, do ya have any more?

No? Ok, no problem…

The circus baby says, “Hooray for donuts!”
