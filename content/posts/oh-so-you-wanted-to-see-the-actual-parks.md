I’m trying my best to summarize our almost 2 week vacation, so as to keep you up to date with our circus adventures, without boring you with every.single.picture we took (if you knew how many pics we took, you would realize this is NO.SMALL.FEAT).&#160; I realized today though that I haven’t really posted any pictures of the actual parks yet.&#160; Hmmm…perhaps I should do something about that.

So, any guesses on which national park this is from?

Still no?&#160;
