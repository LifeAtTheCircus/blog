I have a problem.  Despite my best intentions, I seem incapable of returning library books on time.  Upon returning home from the library, my husband often asks, "So, how much are these going to cost us?" It seems our library visits are taking a dramatic turn for the worst.  

Even after [our bad experience at the library](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/05/09/its-the-begining-of-the-end/) , I took the kids back for books.   This last time we weren't scolded for our "inside voices" so I thought all was good.  BUT, when we got home our baby girl ripped one of the pages in our book.  I told the children we'd have to tell the librarian when we returned it.  

Our next trip to the library my son dutifully reminded me, "Mom don't forget to tell them what she did to the book!"  I was sure to tell the librarian as we returned the book expecting we'd have to pay a small fine or something and they'd tape the page back together.  I was informed we'd have to pay to replace the book the next time we cheeked out.  I didn't think this would be a big deal and I we went off with the kids wondering what prices the library pays for their books.  

Now in addition to returning one damaged book (BEFORE the due date) I also returned a few late books.  When I went to pay my bill, I was told I owed $18.00!!!!  YIKES!!! Seems the library doesn't buy books at amazon.com. They charge you the price of the book listed on the back cover.  Guess libraries have some sort of deal with children's authors in which they pay the highest price possible for their books.

Their investment paid off too.  We will be visiting the library again tomorrow to return them - one week overdue.  This time I did not actually forget but have instead been unable to find what we need.  I had looked everywhere, checking through all the cases in our cabinet over and over.  I finally found it tonight along with a sick feeling in my stomach as I thought about paying yet another reimbursement fee.  It won't be as bad this time but I think I may take a break on checking out any further materials.  The library circus act is getting a bit too pricey.
