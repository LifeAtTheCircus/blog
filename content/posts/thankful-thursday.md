This morning I woke to sounds of my daughter coughing…I stumbled into her room to comfort her and set up her nebulizer, thinking to myself that at least I had gotten 2 hours of uninterrupted sleep.&#160; Then my eyes focused a bit more and I took a second look at the clock.&#160; It was 6:15, not 1:15! 

We slept through the night!&#160; I felt much like a new mom the morning after her baby makes it all night without a feeling!&#160; Instantly rejuvenated with the mere knowledge that I had a full night of sleep! 

More exciting that a full night of rest was the realization that the girls had made it through the night without any major coughing episodes.&#160; My middle child,&#160; who struggles with asthma and was diagnosed with pneumonia yesterday (that’s right she tackled [stitches](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/01/12/she-really-is-super-girl/) and pneumonia in the same week) had gone 11 hrs without needing a breathing treatment!&#160; As I put the medicine in her nebulizer and set her up, I couldn’t wait to e-mail Scott and tell him our good news.&#160;&#160; Scott’s been away on a business trip for the past few days, sadly leaving me alone for the long nights of sickness.&#160; 

But God is so good.&#160; I have truly felt the prayers of friends and family who prayed for healing and stamina and strength.&#160; And today, I am focusing on the many, many things I have to give thanks for this Thursday&#160; morning.&#160; 

*   a good night of sleep for all of us
*   Scott comes home today
*   good doctors
*   medicine
*   drive thru pharmacies
*   the fact that we’ve been able to manage my daughter’s asthma this sickness without her having an asthma attack or needing to use the strong medicine reserved for when she’s really struggling
*   our cell phone which allows Scott to make and e-mail little video greetings to the kids—they love these and watch them over and over, making the separation much easier
*   our cell phone which allows me to e-mail and call Scott to keep him filled in on the events at home—making the separation much easier
*   did I mention Daddy comes home today??
*   for the first time in 4 days, both girls woke with no temperatures!
*   for the first time in 4 days the girls slept through the night
*   God’s strength and stamina
*   the fact that I wasn’t sick this week and having to care for sick kids while feeling sick
*   the baby I feel kicking around in my belly
*   the fact that my son wasn’t sick this week as well  

Today, I feel blessed and cared for and so thankful.&#160; Sure we still have some “cough-es” as the girls call them and my youngest is still quite drippy and a tad whiny, but, we are on the mend… rounding a corner here at the circus.&#160; And I praise God for His care for us this week.&#160; With all that is going on in the world, the fact that our creator God cares about me and my little family is overwhelming and I just have to say thanks.&#160; 

**_Psalm 100:4_**

**_Enter his gates with thanksgiving          
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; and his courts with praise;           
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; give thanks to him and praise his name._**
