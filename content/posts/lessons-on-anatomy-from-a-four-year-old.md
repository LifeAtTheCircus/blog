As my kids were getting ready for their bath the other night the following conversation took place.
 > Sister:  What's that?  (she's pointing at his nipple)
> 
> Brother:  It's the thing you guys (pause) girls have to give babies milk when they don't use bottles.

I know that I shouldn't be, but I am continually amazed by how much the information kids absorb just by watching the world around them, and how much they remember!    It has been a pleasure lately watching my son take on the role of teacher to his younger siblings, whether it be lessons in the alphabet, catechism, or even anatomy.    As long as they don't do any [science labs](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/10/21/so-does-this-mean-we-have-a-future-brain-surgeon-on-our-hands/) anytime soon, I think we'll be ok.
