Today my son spontaneously came up to my 2 year old and gave her a kiss.   Afterwards the following discussion took place.  

Daughter: "No kiss, Only Daddy Kiss."  

Mommy: "But he's your brother and he was being nice."  

Daughter: "No, only Daddy kiss."  

Mommy: "So, the only boy that can kiss you is Daddy?"  

Daughter: "Yes"  

Daddy was a happy man when I shared this anecdote.
