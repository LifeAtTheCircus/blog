My son really took an interest in golfing this weekend while watching my husband follow the U.S. Open.   My husband rarely golfs but does have a set of clubs and after very persistent requests, my husband let my son use his clubs in the back yard.  He taught him the different types of clubs (drivers, putters, irons) and when they are used.  My son had a blast hitting the ball with the putter (which was almost as long as him) in the back yard and then running over to putt it into the pretend hole (between my husband's legs).  

At one point he really started just randomly swinging at the ball and not really being intentional about it so  Scott slowed him down and said,  "you really need to focus on the ball before you swing".  Here is a clip of what my son did  as a result.  I had a hard time not laughing while taking this video clip.  Note the intensity my son displays.  






  

That boy makes me laugh.

Besides playing very focused golf, my son is also quite the critic.  While watching the U.S. Open on Father's Day, I overheard the following conversation.  

_"Dad, is that Tiger Woods?"_

"Yup"

Tiger then makes a huge drive to get the ball onto the green.

My son sees that the ball is near the hole, but it didn't go into the hole.

_"Dad, I thought you said Tiger Woods was good.  He didn't get it into the hole."_

Well son, he is good.  You aren't always able to hit it right into the hole.  It was good that he drove the ball 300 yards to get it near the hole.  Then, he'll hit it in.

_"Oh,"_ - my son wasn't as impressed with this talent.

On Monday my son had the following conversation with me.

_"Mom, is Tiger Woods real?"_

"Yea, why?"

_"Because I saw him on TV"_ 

I realized then that most of watch he has seen on TV has been cartoons and we have been very careful to make sure he knows they are not real.

"Yes, Tiger Woods is real, you were watching pictures of him golfing in real life."

_"Oh, does Daddy golf with Tiger Woods."_

chuckle

"No, Daddy's never golfed with Tiger."

_"Has he golfed at the same grass?"_

another chuckle

"No, Daddy golfed at a different course."

I love the innocence of youth.
