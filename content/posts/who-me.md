Keep it real… I try really hard to make that my mantra in blogging and in life.  That is why I leap at the chance to participate in carnivals like this one, where I can join up wither other real bloggers and rip off any fake facades of perfection.  Because really, who has time for facades when you’re chasing three naked kids around the house, trying to find matching shoes, and attempting to get out the door on time?  

So, in the interest of keeping it real, here’s my list of not me moments this past week…  

Who was busy on the computer and ignored the sounds of her kids carrying something up the stairs, b/c “hey, they seem to be getting along and surely they aren’t doing anything too out of the ordinary”  only to discover that her 5 and 3 year old had carried this JEEP upstairs and plopped it into the nursery?  Not me…

It also wasn’t me who that same day wrote in twitter about discovering “a bag of doritos, sleeve of crackers, and bag of hot dog buns hidden under daughter's blankets in her room-a hidden midnight stash?”  Not me… I keep a closer watch on my kids than that, come on!  

Who served her kids kidney bean sandwiches (at their request) and then made them finish them when they decided they weren’t as good as they thought they would be?  Disgusting, not me….

It certainly wasn’t me who upon discovering a puddle of spilled milk and pee, stopped to snap a picture before cleaning up the mess and putting a diaper back on her youngest piddler?  And not, it wasn’t me whose daughter was running around buck naked.

And while it looked like the circus, it wasn’t me who showed up at swim class last week with her son only wearing one shoe because I was sure the other one was in the van and when it wasn’t didn’t have time to run back in and look for it, so “oh well, go with one, we’re just walking in to the locker room anyway where you’d take it off to go to the pool”…  

Remember my garden I worked so hard to [prep a few weeks ago](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/05/19/wow-i-did-it/)?  Well, it is not my veggies that you see sitting on the front window sill two weeks later waiting to be planted.  Nope, not me at all….
