The other day I was driving my oldest two children home when they suggested I text their Nana to see if the younger two were asleep so we’d know if we needed to enter in the backdoor.

I told them I couldn’t text while driving, but maybe if I got a red light I could send her a quick txt.&#160; _(I know, I know….)_

Well the light was green and as we got rather close to our street my 5 yr old daughter says, “Mom, you gotta send the text!”&#160; “I can’t,” I replied, the light was green.&#160; 

“Well Mom, I’ll watch the road for you and tell you if your going to hit something.” 

“Thanks, but it doesn’t work like that, I need to be watching the road myself.” 

“Why Mom?&#160; Don’t you know this road pretty well, you drive on it all the time?”

I then went on to tell her while I know the road, I don’t know what the other cars are going to do on the road.&#160;&#160; And even though she promised to keep an eye for me, I think it would be better for me to watch. 

Can you just imagine?&#160; Well, officer, I know I wasn’t watching, but she was my lookout…yea… my 5 yr old in the back seat… she promised to keep an eye out for me….
