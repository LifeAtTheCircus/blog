My daughter is a fierce competitor.&#160; Everything, and I mean everything can be turned to a competition with her.&#160; Last weekend when we were driving back to the camp site from training camp, Scott and I drove my parents van and let my parents follow us with the kids in our van. We pulled in to Dairy Queen as a fun surprise and she says to my dad, “Now’s your chance to beat them… keep driving Papa!”

Not only does she thrive on competition, but the girl cares a lot and I mean A LOT about winning.&#160; This of course means that she also hates to lose.&#160; At anything… getting to the van, tic tac toe, Uno….&#160; We’ve worked a lot this past year on her temper and I have seen her&#160; mature and grow a lot.&#160; 

Lately, her way to ensure that she always wins, is by refusing to play any game that is as she calls it “a winner/loser game.”&#160; If there is a chance she can lose, she doesn’t want to play… Tic-tac-toe, Wii, Uno, Hi Ho Cherrio, you name it… her response is always, “I’ll just watch I don’t like winning/losing games.”&#160; 

I applaud the fact that she recognizes the fact that she doesn’t like losing and thus since she can’t guarantee a win, she’s removing the obstacle at hand.&#160;&#160; In a way, it shows a self awareness and even an element of self control.&#160; 

But, she has to learn to lose graciously.&#160; She can’t always win.&#160; In fact it’s one reason why I love my kids playing sports.&#160; I love that they learn to work on a team and they learn to win and lose.&#160;&#160;&#160; But, at her age, they don’t keep score in soccer, so she hasn’t really had to learn to lose.&#160; 

I don’t know how to teach her.&#160; I don’t want her to just not play.&#160;&#160; Her older brother has graciously offered to promise to lose when they play games just because he’s desperate for a playmate and it’s the only way she’ll agree.&#160;&#160;&#160; But not only is that not fair to her, it isn’t teaching her anything either.&#160; She can’t go out in the world and expect other kids to agree to lose for her.&#160;&#160; So, do I force her to play these “winner/loser games” that she doesn’t want to play so that she’ll get experience losing?&#160; (hmmm sounds like 2 battles waiting for me)&#160; 

Any of you out there have experience with this that you can pass along?&#160; The easy thing to do would be just let her not play, but I don’t think that is what she needs.
