I was brushing my daughter's hair the other day when I noticed how long and pretty it was getting.  
 > Me:  Wow, your hair is getting long and so pretty
> 
> Daughter: No I'm not
> 
> Me:  Why not?  What do you want it to be?
> 
> Daughter: I want to be nice and kind.
> 
> (My son starts giggling at this point)
> 
> Me: Hmmm that's good, but you can be nice and kind and still have pretty hair.
> 
> Daughter: No 

This conversation can mostly be chocked up to the stubborn desire of a two year old to go against whatever her Mommy was saying, BUT... there is some truth to the words.   

1 Peter 3:3-4 states, _"Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes. Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight."_

While there is nothing wrong with being pretty, our focus should not be on our outward appearance, but on our inner self.  As I raise my daughters, I hope I can raise them to be truly beautiful women of God.
