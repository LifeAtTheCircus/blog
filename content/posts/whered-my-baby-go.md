I baby him. 

A lot.

I know I never, ever babied any of my others like I do him.&#160; It’s mostly because I know he’s my last, but also because he lets me.&#160; 

He weighs 27 lbs

and will be 2 in three months, and yet most days you’ll find me carrying him on my hip.&#160; I joked the other day that you’ll probably find me carrying him in to kindergarten.&#160; 

By far his most favorite toy is a ball.&#160; He still thinks all balls are footballs and before he throws you a ball he will hold it down to the ground and say, “hike-hike-hike”&#160; Which when he does it with his Steelers football, it fills this Momma with pride, but when he does it to say a soccer or baseball, it brings a giggle.&#160; 

Today the kids and I went in the back yard to play and as I watched him, I realized how much of a little boy he is. 

Try as I&#160; might to keep him my baby, he really is growing up.&#160; I guess it’s a good thing he has older siblings, because they keep **
me 
**in line.&#160; They don’t baby him nearly as much as I do, nor do they let him get away with us much as I do either.&#160; (_his adorable smile seems lost on them when he sneaks an extra cookie or gets into a mess_)

Today as my 4 year old lifted him onto the big kid swing and pushed him, I watched in awe as he held on tight and giggled.&#160; He loved every minute of it.&#160;&#160; As he did climbing the ladder to the club house and sliding down the slide into his sisters arms.&#160;

Of course, I can’t yet leave alone in the yard with the big 3 to play, I need to be there to catch and comfort.&#160; But, he’s ready to play and explore.&#160; And I can’t hold him back.&#160; 

He wants to do everything they do…&#160; even if it means riding a pink bike.&#160;

As I watched them play for hours in the warm spring sun,&#160; I had that all too familiar feeling

that despite Momma’s best intentions

my baby is turning into a “big kid.”

Just look at him here, does he look like a baby to you?

What is going on?
