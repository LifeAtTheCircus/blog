My daughter sleeps with so many animals, pillows, dolls, and blankets in her bed, that sometimes when I go in to kiss her before I go to bed, I can’t find her.&#160; 

One night I thought I saw her and then realized I almost kissed her cabbage patch doll.&#160; 

Can you find her in the pile?&#160; It reminds me of the old [Where’s Waldo](http://www.findwaldo.com/) books.[![IMG_7962](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_7962.jpg "IMG_7962")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_7962.jpg)

Here’s a closer look… there she is!
