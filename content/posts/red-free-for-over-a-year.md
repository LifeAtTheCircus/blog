It’s been over a year now since we removed Red Lake 40 from our children’s diets.&#160; Cutting a processed food from our family’s diet was not a natural move for us.&#160; However, it has made a HUGE, HUGE impact on our family life and since I decided to do it after reading a blog once, I thought perhaps I should document our experience in case it might help someone else.&#160; 

The summer of 2012 I noticed that one of my children was having outrageous I mean OUTRAGEOUS temper tantrums.&#160; The littlest thing could set her off into a FIT of FURY.&#160; Kicking, screaming, fists wailing, it was all I could do to physically get her upstairs to her room where she would continue to rage for about 45 minutes or so.&#160; There was no reasoning with her.&#160; And truthfully, no controlling her either.&#160; I would sit outside her door tears streaming down my face praying for wisdom and wondering where on earth did we go wrong.&#160;&#160; As the summer progressed I grew quite fearful of what the school year would bring.&#160; Scott and I talked, wondering if I’d be able to continue to home school.&#160; How could we possible deal with these tantrums and teach 3 kids?&#160; 

Finally we hit rock bottom and decided something had to be done.&#160; I recalled reading something online about how red food coloring affected this mom’s child and how when she removed it from their diet she saw dramatic effects.&#160; Desperate, we decided to keep a food log. 

 I have to tell you that we had gotten into the habit of eating quite a lot of mac n cheese.&#160; Aldi’s sold it for around 30 cents a box and this child in particular loved it.&#160; Couldn’t find an easier, cheaper lunch so it was often on the menu.&#160; My kids also LOVED fruit snacks and I would buy them frequently for them to snack on in the car.&#160;&#160; As I started charting what she ate and her outbursts I began to see a correlation.&#160; I decided to start buying dye free mac n cheese and got rid of the fruit snacks.&#160; The school year started and we noticed FAR LESS outbursts.&#160; They still happened, but not with the frequency we had seen before.&#160; 

Then December came and with it Candy Canes.&#160; I guess by this point since the outbursts had lessened, I wasn’t staying as vigilant, because I let the kids have candy canes.&#160;&#160; And we had some major episodes.&#160; And I have to tell&#160; you that I didn’t put it together right away.&#160; But, one day after we had had several days in a row and one major epic tantrum.&#160; (kicking screaming, horrible aggressive behavior, picking fights, not listening to reasoning, hitting) I told my husband.&#160; And he right away called it.&#160; “Did she have any candy canes?”&#160; 

OF COURSE

They had been eating candy canes every day that week.&#160; And candy canes have red dye. 

It was then that we decided we could no longer take a passive approach to the red dye.&#160; Between candy treats at school or gymnastics, there was no way for me to control it.&#160; They had to know and they had to be on top of it also.&#160;&#160; We had to sit the kids down and say no more red dye.&#160; We taught them to read labels.&#160; 

I didn’t want to single one child out.&#160; And I didn’t want to say, “this dye makes you act bad” b/c I didn’t want the dye to be a crutch used as an excuse for bad behavior.&#160;&#160; So we told them none of them could have it due to an allergic reaction we had seen.&#160; 

Red dye is in SO much… Doritos,&#160; fruit roll ups, like every fun kid cereal there is, pretty much every fruity candy there is, M&amp;Ms…. It’s in yellow food coloring.&#160; It’s in some yellow and chocolate cake mixes and icing.&#160; It’s in chocolate pudding.&#160; At first we did a great job of spotting it in the obvious places.&#160; No red ring pops.&#160; But what about the less obvious places?&#160; Yellow cup cakes or grape ring pops, or strawberry gogurt.&#160; We learned to read labels.&#160; 

We have not removed all dyes from their diet.&#160; The one that had the most dramatic effect was red dye and we took it in baby steps.&#160; They have been red dye free for over a year.&#160; They hate Valentine’s day parties b/c they pretty much come home with a bag of candy they can’t eat.&#160; I started buying dye free lollipops from Trader Joes and when they get a candy somewhere that they can’t have they trade it in for one they can have.&#160; 

They have been SO good about it.&#160; They always ask if there is red dye in something before they eat it.&#160; _My 3 year old is so funny b/c if he asks for something and if I say no he instant assumes it’s b/c of red dye.&#160; We were at the store yesterday and he wanted to buy the milk with a blue cap (It was 2% and I had just put skim in our cart)&#160; No I told him, we don’t need that milk.&#160; “Oh”&#160; he said, “Does it have red dye?”&#160;_ 

I have to say that the change in her behavior was almost unbelievable.&#160; The fits of rage are gone.&#160; We’ve had a few over the past year and I am positive they came when a bit of red dye slipped through un noticed in a food we didn’t think to check.&#160; We most certainly would have been taking her to the Dr and probably had to put her on medication b/c her outbursts had gotten that bad.&#160; And none of that would have been necessary b/c removing this dye was all that was needed.&#160; Can you imagine?&#160;&#160; I would have been thinking I was helping her, giving her medication she didn’t need and it all had to do with a chemical put in her food and candy?&#160; 

Keep in mind I am not saying my child is now perfect b/c we took red dye out of their diet.&#160; She still disobeys, she still sins, she even still hits her brother and sister when she’s mad, but she is no longer out of control.&#160; Now I can discipline her.&#160;&#160; I can send her to her room with out having to physically carry her up the stairs.&#160; I can talk to her about her behavior and have a reasonable conversation.&#160; Before I had to literally wait out the storm before we could discuss the behavior and give consequences.&#160; And she always took those consequences well (after she settled down).&#160; She’d admit that she was out of line, was sorry and had no idea why she kept doing it.&#160; 

I am not alone.&#160; Google red lake 40 and you’ll read others stories like ours.&#160; I don’t know why it effects one of my children and not the others.&#160;&#160; But, I do know it has made a DRAMTIC effect on our family life.&#160; And I share this with you, incase you find yourself in a similar place to where we were a year and a half ago.&#160; Maybe a food log might be a good first step for you too.
