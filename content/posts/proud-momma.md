Their class did a floor routine (which was super cute to watch) and then each girl had a chance to perform on the bars, trampoline, and tumble track.&#160;&#160;

The event concluded with a trip to the medal stand for each girl and then the opportunity to pose for pictures afterwards.&#160; In January, the girls were placed into the same class.&#160; This was nice, not only b/c it allowed me to take fewer trips to the gym each week, but also b/c the girls really enjoyed being together in class.&#160; This summer my older daughter will move up to a new class.&#160; I hope though, that it isn’t the last time they share practice time.&#160;

They both worked so hard this year and learned so many new skills.&#160; I love, LOVE watching them work hard in the gym as well as practice their skills in the living room floor, on what they have deemed the “gymnastics couch” and on the sidelines of their brothers baseball games.&#160; I am very proud of my 2 little gymnasts!
