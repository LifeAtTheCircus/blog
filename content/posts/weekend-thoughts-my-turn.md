In my last weekend thought post, I mentioned my desire to teach my children to live their life in full and not let fear keep them from enjoying life’s pleasures.&#160; Ironically enough a week later I found myself having to choose between sitting on the sidelines or facing my fear.

15 years ago I got on a Gerris wheel with my friends.&#160; It seemed harmless enough at the time.&#160; But the combination of the height and the swaying car sent me into a full fledge panic.&#160; I don’t recall much, other than screaming at the top of my lungs, pleading with the attendant as I passed him, begging him to make it stop and let me off.&#160; 

No such luck for me (or for my incredibly embarrassed friend who was stuck sitting next to me during my loud panic attack).&#160; 

Ever since, I have avoided Ferris Wheels with great success.

Until the county fair this year.&#160; As the day for the fair approached my son starting talking about how much he was looking forward to the Ferris wheel.&#160; (enter feeling of dread and despair in my stomach).&#160;&#160; My initial response was, “No, we won’t be going on that b/c Dad won’t be with us.”

But then we got there.&#160; And he never begged or whined.&#160; But I saw him look up.&#160; And the words of my post the week prior, ran through my mind.&#160;&#160; 
  > “I don’t want to miss out on the smiles and fun God has planned for us b/c of fear or stress of what we’ll loose.&#160;&#160; I want us to fully enjoy the moments we’re in.”  

And I knew that I had to do it.&#160; In fact more than that, I wanted to do it.&#160; My friend offered to take my kids with hers.&#160; But, I wanted to push that fear down and enjoy the ride with my kids.&#160; I didn’t want to let my fear keep me on the sideline while she got to enjoy the look of delight on their faces.&#160;

At first I gripped the pole in the center and just started straight ahead silently willing my 2 year old not to move on my lap and praying the older two would sit still across from me.&#160; 

But, then I realized I was enjoying myself.&#160; I didn’t feel sick or panicked.&#160;&#160; And so I pulled out my camera.&#160; 

I am so glad I didn’t let my fear sideline me.&#160; Not only did I get to enjoy the view from atop

but, more importantly, I got to enjoy the view with my kids as I got to enjoy watching them enjoy the view from atop.&#160;

And that was, for me, the best part.&#160; 

Motherhood is a lot like that Ferris Wheel ride.&#160; It pushes you do things you never thought possible, but in doing so, you get to experience the ride of your life.
