We have a few daily battles here at the circus which I have to mediate carefully.&#160; One involves who buckled their top straps first in the car seat and the other is over who gets to eat off of the coveted plate at meal time.&#160; 

I made the innocent mistake of purchasing three different animal face plates last year at Target.&#160; I also bought some basic color plates as well.&#160;&#160; I was careful to make sure I got red and purple (my son and daughter’s favorite colors as well as 2 others since they baby didn’t yet have an opinion on colors and it was nice to have extras for when friends are visiting)[![IMG_3181](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-3181-thumb.jpg "IMG_3181")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-3181.jpg).[![IMG_3186](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-3186-thumb.jpg "IMG_3186")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-3186.jpg) 

I remember bringing them home with excitement, our first kid plates, weren’t they cute?&#160; 

And for awhile all went smoothly.&#160; 

But, somewhere in the last year my daughter decided her favorite things were whatever her big brother liked best.&#160; So, since he wanted the frog plate at dinner, she too wanted the frog plate.&#160; And poor mr monkey and miss lady bug were cast offs.&#160; I suddenly had to keep track of who ate on the frog plate yesterday and whose turn it was tomorrow.&#160; And when the frog plate is dirty, we then resort to colors.&#160; The colors worked for awhile b/c my daughter liked purple and my son liked red.&#160; For awhile I just hid mr frog because the colors kept the peace.

Until my daughter decided that she too liked red.

Now, I have to keep track of who ate off of the frog and who ate off of the red plate. 

I have one saving grace though.

Noah’s Ark.

Not sure exactly where we acquired this plate, I think it was in a box of hand me down toys someone gave us.&#160; But my daughter has latched on to the Noah plate because, “Hey, we learned about Noah in my Sunday School class.”&#160; And since my daughter has taken such affection towards the Noah plate, my son now shows an interest in it as well.&#160; 

Of course.

But Noah does help keep the peace, because if my son has the frog, my daughter is happy if she has Noah.&#160; And vice versa.

Inevitably there are days when Noah and Mr Frog are both in the dish washer and I have to keep track of the red plate and who ate on what when.&#160; 

Some days I say “Forget it, no one gets to eat off of the red plate, or the frog plate, or Noah plate.”&#160; Admittedly, this is usually said in frustration and met with great weeping and gnashing of teeth as they have to “suffer” with eating off of the monkey or lady bug.&#160; Some days, I don’t feel like negotiating and I just give the coveted plate to the baby, who doesn’t yet care.&#160; Some days I keep track of who had what when.&#160; Some days I patiently explain that we have to share and take turns and we can’t all have what we want when we want it.&#160; 

Most days I regret bringing home the cute kid plates and am wondering why I didn’t just bring home 5 plastic white plates and call it a day.&#160; I’m pretty sure that’s what an experienced mom would have done.&#160; And I’m pretty sure where communism got it’s start.

In a home with three children all fighting over the coveted dinner plate.
