Despite wet ground and a rainy forecast all systems were go for the Cub Scout rocket launch this morning.&#160;

And, I gotta come clean on this one… it was WAY cooler than I thought it would be.&#160; 

They built the rockets at home and then went to the field to stuff them and other technical stuff which I didn’t really follow all to closely.

Then they set the rockets up on their “launch pads”

He was able to launch his rocket 3 times.&#160; Unfortunately, the last time it was lost in space…. such a fun way to spend our Saturday morning.&#160; Thanks again Cub Scouts for providing us with a educational and fun family experience.
