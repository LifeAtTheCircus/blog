Heard round the circus this past week…

From my 4 year old:

“Your right hand can’t know what your left hand is doing…unless your giving a hug, then it’s ok.”

Again from my 4 year old:

After pouring peroxide on her cut, she looked up at me with tears in her eyes and said, “Mom, that burns like Sprite!” _(soooo hard not to laugh while she was obviously in pain)_

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When my almost 2 year old spilled milk all over the table, I said, “Thanks so much buddy.”&#160; He looked up at me with a huge smile and said for the very first time, “Your welcome!”&#160; (_apparently sarcasm is lost on the under 2 crowd)_
