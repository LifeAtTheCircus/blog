Typically, I try not to make this a picture blog or just a family scrapbook type blog.&#160; I try to mix it up a little with the blog content and I do my best to show restraint on pictures.&#160; (believe it or not)

Therefore I felt it necessary to give you a heads up that at least for the next week or so, there are going to be a lot of pictures on the blog.&#160; We have a new cast member here at the circus and we are quite smitten with him.&#160; Prepare yourself for the onslaught of photographs coming soon!!
