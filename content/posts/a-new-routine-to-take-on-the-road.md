Driving home the other day my 2 year old, called from the back of the van, "Excuse me mom, where's baby?" I would have panicked had I not just heard her babbling moments before.   Since, it was obvious she was there, I answered with something silly like, "Driving the car." She erupted in giggles and thus began our newest comedy routine.  

This was our conversation all the way to church this morning, in the parking lot after church while we were waiting for Daddy to finish talking, on the way out to lunch, on the way home....  

"Excuse me Mom, where's baby?"

"On the roof"

hahahahahahahahaha

"Excuse me Mom, where's baby?"

"On the floor"

hahahahahahahahaha

"Excuse me Mom, where's baby?"

"In the back"

hahahahahahahahaha

"Excuse me Mom, where's baby?"

"At the fire station"'

hahahahahahahahaha

Just for fun, I stuck in "in her car seat"  or "right there" and she would still erupt into giggles. THIS makes me laugh.  While the routine itself doesn't exactly make me laugh, I can't help but laugh at her hysterical giggles.

This is what is making us laugh this week, to read what's making other people laugh, check out...
