In the past month, these pictures were taken during meal time at our home.&#160; I can assure you that these antics don’t take place regularly around here, but at the same time, they do happen.&#160; After all, it is the circus.

Exhibit A: playing with our food

Yes, that would be my son eating his applesauce while sitting on his Daddy’s shoulders (and yes, to make it truly circus like, he’s in his underwear).&#160; 

When my son came up with this “bright” and fun idea my husband thought a moment and responded, “Sure, why not, BUT only this once).&#160; 

You see why I call it Life At The Circus?
