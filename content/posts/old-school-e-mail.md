My oldest two have gotten into the [habit of “e-mailing”](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/10/08/naptime-e-mails/) each other at the beginning of nap time.&#160;&#160;&#160; And by e-mailing they really mean they are drawing pictures and writing messages back and forth to each other.&#160; We’ve worked out a system in which they are allowed to e-mail for the first 30 minutes of nap time.&#160; Then, they have to have quiet time in separate rooms for the remaining hour and a half.&#160;&#160; 

I have become a huge fan of the e-mailing time.&#160; It is quite precious as a mom to hear them whisper and slipping messages to each other under their doors.&#160; It is the most peaceful, argument free time of my day.&#160; And sometimes I permit the e-mail time to extend past the designated 30 minute time slot. 

These e-mails are not paper less however and quite a lot of drawings and messages are created each week.&#160; I simply can not save them all as we’d be drowning in paper trails.&#160; 

But, from time to time I set aside [some gems](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/10/08/naptime-e-mails/) that I simply can’t part with.&#160; Some for sentimental reasons, some because I am impressed with the art work, some because they just make me smile, and serve as momentos of days gone by. 

Here are a few recent ones my son drew for his sister. 

I loved this one because it was obvious, to me, upon seeing it who he drew.&#160; Can you identify the princess he drew for his sister?

Then there is Dora’s mom.&#160; This one gave me quite a startle.&#160; It was one of the original e-mails he drew months ago.&#160;&#160; I had no idea Dora’s mother was so heavily endowed!

I know I have mentioned baby Eli here before.&#160; Eli is one of my children’s cousin’s and he is adored here at the circus.&#160; In fact, both girls&#160; have renamed their baby dolls Eli.&#160; And my son has taken on the roll of Eli’s dad.&#160; 

Here is a picture my son drew of my daughter when she had baby Eli at the hospital.&#160;

On the left side, you’ll notice the doctor and my son holding baby Eli.&#160; Then there is my daughter on the hospital bed in the middle.&#160; And lastly there is my daughter holding baby Eli. 

I greatly enjoy seeing the drawings my son makes for his sister.&#160; I never know what he’ll come up with next. 

Isn’t it funny they call this e-mailing instead of letter writing?&#160; Sign of the times, I suppose.
