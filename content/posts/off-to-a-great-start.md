We started on our grand adventure yesterday morning.  We set off a little later than we had hoped due to some storm preparations we had to make in case the forecasted impending storms took out our power while we were gone.  

Our plan for day one was to drive from Annapolis, MD to Nashville, TN.  Our route took us through DC which was a fun start.

The kids did great on day 1.  We made 2 bathroom stops and an extended stop at Chick-Fil-A for dinner, the playground, and ice cream .   The kids stayed pretty entertained through the car ride.  

We then spent Friday relaxing with Scott’s cousin and her family.  She has 6 kids and 2 cats and the circus kids had a blast with all of them.  Not to mention they had a pool in their back yard.  We went swimming three different times in one day.

For those that have been following our 5 year olds please for a cat… looks like we now have 2 circus kids pining for one… anyone care to wager how long till the circus fam adds a cat to the crew?

After weeks of round the clock prepping and to do lists, it was so refreshing to just spend a day chilling.  A wonderful start to our grand adventure.
