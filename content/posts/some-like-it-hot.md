The first national park on this grand adventure was Hot Springs National Park in Hot Springs, AR.

It seems we are passing on the sign picture tradition… as everyone wanted a picture of the sign with their camera.[![IMG_0239](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0239.jpg "IMG_0239")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0239.jpg)&#160; 

The town of Hot Springs was built to capitalize on the hot springs of water coming out of the ground in that area.[![IMG_0291](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0291.jpg "IMG_0291")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0291.jpg)&#160; [![IMG_0258](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0258.jpg "IMG_0258")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0258.jpg)

Numerous bath houses were built here in the early 1900s.&#160;&#160;

You could actually feel the heat coming from the ground near the spring.&#160; [![IMG_0352](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0352.jpg "IMG_0352")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0352.jpg)

And we were able to stick our fingers in and touch it.&#160; It was indeed hot.&#160; [![IMG_0251](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0251.jpg "IMG_0251")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0251.jpg)

After touching the hot spring we took a walk around the promonade.[![IMG_0401](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0401.jpg "IMG_0401")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_0401.jpg)

&#160; It was wonderful to get out and stretch our feet.&#160; It was a beautiful evening for a stroll (or cartwheels).&#160;

And we even found some dirt and rocks!

Before we left we filled our water bottles with fresh, hot spring water.&#160;

One of the rangers told us that people will drive monthly from hours away to fill up jugs of this fresh, unpolluted spring water.&#160; While I don’t think Hot Springs will rank amongst the top of the National Parks we visit this trip, it was a fun stop and it exceeded my expectations.
