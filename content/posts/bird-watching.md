When I came out to the kitchen to make breakfast this morning, I felt a cold draft.&#160; I then noticed my son sitting in the sliding glass door.&#160;

He told me he was listening to the birds in the backyard.&#160; They were offering up a beautiful melody.&#160; One thing I love about life with small children is that they help you to stop and take notice of the everyday miracles in the world around you.&#160; How often do we just sit and listen to the birds?&#160; 

After awhile though, I was cold so I told him to put a coat on and sit outside to listen.&#160; He made some toast and took his breakfast outside on this cold February morning to spend some more time with his beloved birds.&#160;

As is often the case, it didn’t take long for his younger sisters to follow his lead.&#160; 

Check out their bird watching attire.&#160;

On mornings like this, I love the flexibility of home schooling.&#160; I love that we can just start our day a little later and let them follow their whims a bit.&#160; We can’t let their whims direct our entire day, but it was a sweet start to our morning.&#160;
