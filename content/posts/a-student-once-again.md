I do not consider myself to be either creative or crafty.&#160; And most of the time I am ok with that.&#160; Even though my mom and grandma are both talented seamstresses, I’ve often joked that I missed out on the sewing gene. 

The truth is that sewing seems to require patience and an aspiration for perfection.&#160; And for me, close enough is usually more than good enough.&#160; But close enough doesn’t seem to work when sewing, b/c you kinda want your dresses to be straight and your sleeves even.&#160; 

So, I typically don’t even try to sew and get my sister in law, mom, or talented friend Jen, to do it for me.&#160; 

My kids know this and when they need their slippers patched or a stuffed animal repaired they don’t even bother to ask me, they just pack it up and when we see Grandma or Aunt Karen next they’ll pull it out and ask her to repair it for them.&#160; I’ll often laugh about the fact that they didn’t even bother asking me.&#160; 

Then I found out one of my dear friends and her mother in law (one of my favorite high school teachers) are teaching a intro to sewing class for adults.&#160;&#160; And I jumped at the chance to try. 

I get to bring my sewing machine to use (this I think will be huge as I will learn&#160; how to use my machine).&#160; And they’ve got a slew of projects planned for the semester that will teach us all sorts of basic sewing skills and provide us with useful products.&#160; (aprons, bags, pillows…)&#160; 

Tonight we met at Jo Ann Fabrics.&#160; They walked us around the store telling us about the different kinds of fabrics and which kinds were easy to sew with and which are more difficult.&#160; 

They answered questions and encouraged.&#160; They started with the basics, as in very, very basic.&#160; 

When I left the house I foolishly thought I’d be buying all the fabric I needed for all 7 classes.&#160; After staring at material for over an hour, I left with the material needed for our first project.&#160; 

Lesson One:&#160; choosing fabric takes time&#160; (and I made a mental note to myself that there is no way I am bringing my kids with me to the fabric store, ever)

I am really excited about this class.&#160; We’ll be meeting twice a month for the next few months.&#160; I feel like this class is just what I need right now. I am excited about the opportunity to have a night out.&#160; I am excited to spend time with friends.&#160; I am excited about the opportunity to accomplish some tangible projects for myself and my family.&#160; And I am excited to spend time with one of my favorite teachers again.&#160;&#160; Can you tell I am a little excited?

Oh, and I bought my own pair of fabric scissors!&#160; I couldn’t wait to tell my mom that I too have special scissors that the kids can’t cut with paper.&#160; 

Next week, I will be making 2 aprons.. one half apron and one bib apron.&#160; I am super excited!&#160; (must think of another word with which I can convey my enthusiasm) I will wait to buy the next material after that.&#160; We’re going to take baby steps…&#160; (which is good b/c once I was in the store I found myself wanting to make so many things… I need to take it small and accomplish tangible goals otherwise I will become overwhelmed and will most likely give up… and I really, really want to succeed this time). Perhaps if things turn out like I hope, I’ll post pictures of my finished work.&#160; (unlike [those curtains](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/01/31/new-month-new-week-new-goals/) I aspired to make last spring and never even started) (which , by the way, I am hoping to try and get done this fall)
