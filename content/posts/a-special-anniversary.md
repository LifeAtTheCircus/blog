This weekend marked an anniversary of a life changing event in my life.&#160; In fact, one could say that my life is very, very different as a result of it. 

2 years ago while on our annual Labor Day cabin trip I did something I had never done before.&#160; 

I finished a cup of coffee. 

Sure, I had had a sip once or twice, hoping to like it like my friends… but I never really cared for it. 

And so I gave up, b/c ignorance is bliss.&#160; But I found myself begging my husband to become a coffee drinker just so our house could have that wonderful aroma of coffee brewing each morning. 

He wasn’t interested in “becoming addicted to a drug,” as he put it. 

I don’t know what changed 2 years ago… maybe it was the hormones from child number 4, maybe it was that I finally tasted good coffee (the bolder and stronger the better in my book), but [I fell in love 2 years ago and there is no going back.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/09/29/my-switch-to-the-dark-side/)[![coffee](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/coffee.jpg "coffee")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/coffee.jpg)

I drink a good 4-6 cups a day.&#160; I love the smell, I love the taste, I love the warmth, I love the feel of the mug in my hand as I sip all morning long.&#160; I typically top mine off throughout the morning, it keeps it at just the right temp.&#160; I like mine with sugar, no milk or cream.&#160; 

I actually went from never drinking the stuff, to a coffee snob.&#160; I like the good stuff.&#160; I like it bold.&#160; I like it freshly roasted and freshly ground. 

And then to make life even sweeter, this winter my little brother became a [coffee roaster and sells his own beans](http://avodahcoffee.com/).&#160; I ordered from him the first time because he is my brother and that’s what sisters do.&#160; But, I became a subscriber (which means that I get my coffee shipped monthly to my door) because it is _that_ good and I didn’t want to deal with those terrible headaches I got when I ran out of coffee and had to wait for my next shipment.&#160; It’s good stuff people.&#160; 

Fall is just around the corner… I am eager for Pumpkin Spiced Lattes and then peppermint flavored coffee.&#160;
