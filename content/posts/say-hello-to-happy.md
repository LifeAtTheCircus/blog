_Today, I bring to you Rebecca from_ [_A Happy Heart_](http://ahappyheart-rebecca.blogspot.com/)_.&#160;&#160; Rebecca has been a faithful commenter here at the circus for several months.&#160; Her encouraging and humorous comments have flowed into numerous e-mail exchanges between the two of us.&#160; Without actually meeting her in person, she has crossed the line from “virtual friend” to “real friend” and I look forward to meeting her face to face next month.&#160; She has two adorable preschoolers, two helpful tween stepdaughters, and another little bun in the oven due to arrive in time for Thanksgiving this fall.&#160; She’s one busy momma!&#160; So, without any further ado…here’s Rebecca!!&#160;_ 

When Crystal asked me to guest post for her I was honored and excited, albeit a tad nervous.&#160; It's one thing to ramble without a point over at my own blog, but another thing entirely to take the ceaseless ramblings somewhere else.&#160; 

Crystal suggested I write about how I would fit in with the Circus at which I immediately started to chuckle because while Crystal has certainly cornered the circus market I have my own set of clowns at home who make me feel like I'm walking a tight rope on a daily basis, afraid to look down for fear of seeing my son drinking out of the vaporizer unit or my daughter playing in toilet water.&#160; For someone with OCD tendencies those scenarios can be less than humorous when stumbled upon.&#160; 

However, I'm learning to throw my OCD tendencies to the wind these days and for me that's where Crystal's circus comes in.

A circus isn't a circus without the aspect of fun and I think that is what I'm learning most as a regular reader of Life At The Circus.&#160; I'm learning through Crystal and Scott's parenting style that there can be fun found in everyday if you look hard enough for it and take a moment to savor it.&#160; I'm the type of person who wants to &quot;schedule&quot; fun and let's face it, that takes all the, well, fun out of it.&#160; It seems like Crystal finds the fun in the most ordinary of everyday things and I'm striving to do more of that in my own home.&#160; I'm learning the unexpected fun is the most fun of all.

I've also learned a thing or two about teachable moments.&#160; Again, being a scheduler I want to have a time and place for learning when in fact there are so many teachable moments that pass me by without my even realizing it until it's too late.&#160; With toddlers and pre-school age children it seems almost everything can be drilled down to a teachable moment and that's something I'm realizing more and more as a Circus reader.&#160; It seems not a day goes by that Cyrstal isn't seizing huge opportunities to teach her children.&#160; I'm amazed at her children's understanding of concepts many adults have a hard time grasping such as why we celebrate Christmas. 

A lot of Crystal has been rubbing off on me in the past several months reading her blog.&#160; Most of them I'm thrilled about as I feel they are truly making me a better parent and a better person.

However, there is one thing about Crystal that's rubbing off on me that I'm not sure is a good thing.&#160; Those of you who know Crystal know that laundry is the bane of her existence and while you don't know me well, you should know that I pride myself on a clean and organized home.&#160; 

Or at least I used to.

This is a picture of the scene you will stumble upon when walking into my laundry room right now.&#160; I wish I could say we just recently had a terrible tsunami that's only victims were my whites and darks, but alas, it just isn't so.&#160; 

It's just me trying to fit in with the Circus.&#160;
