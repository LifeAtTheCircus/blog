[![image](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/image-thumb.png)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/image.png)When Scott and I were engaged everyone was reading this book.&#160;&#160;&#160; While we never sat down and read the book we did peruse the chapter headings to determine what the 5 love languages were and it didn't take long for us to figure out which love language each of us spoke.&#160;&#160; We will both tell you that this is the best marriage book we ever 
didn't
 read.&#160; The concepts in this book have truly helped our marriage.

The author says that there are 5 ways people speak and receive love.&#160; These are physical touch, words of affirmation, gifts, quality time, and acts of service.&#160; While people can receive love in more than one language, most people tend to have one language they hear most often.&#160;&#160; Mine is words of affirmation.&#160; Write me a card, send me an e-mail telling me what I mean to you or how you appreciate me and I am a happy girl.&#160; I save them and read them over and over.&#160; Scott's love language is acts of service.&#160; 

A key point was learning to speak your mate's love language.&#160; A big mistake that people often make is to speak their language to their mate and then wonder why he/she doesn't feel loved.&#160; I figured out early on that while words mean a lot to me, they really don't cut it for Scott.&#160; Sappy love notes and cards do not make him feel loved.&#160; He once told me that the joy he got our the my love notes had nothing to do with the words I used but instead, he appreciated the care I put into finding the time to write it.&#160; So, I don't bother with them anymore.&#160;&#160; I do make him his favorite cake from scratch each year on his birthday and it says I love you more than any card ever could.

Likewise, while Scott doesn't naturally communicate through words of affirmation, he knows I need them and doesn't let my needs go unmet.&#160; He'll send me e-mails from work telling me he loves me or sometimes leave notes on the computer saying, &quot;Scott loves his wife&quot;&#160; I keep the note up all day and smile each and every time I see it.&#160; (yes, I am a sap through and through)! 

I should mention that another key thing is learning to receive love in your mate's language.&#160; My native language is still &quot;words&quot; and Scott's is still &quot;service&quot; so it's important we translate when we use our own language to tell the other we love them.&#160;&#160; 

While we never actually read this book, we both highly recommend it, as learning to identify and speak each others love language has had a huge impact on our marriage.&#160; I am able to show him love in a way that he recognizes and he does the same with me.&#160; We can't recommend this book highly enough.

_My posts typically relate funny anecdotes about the happenings here at the circus. While my days are seldom &#8220;normal&#8221; enough to leave me without a &#8220;post worthy&#8221; moment, I use my last post of the week to highlight something a little more &#8220;thoughtful&#8221; and significant. If you had a thoughtful post from this last week, or choose to make a new one, please feel free to add a link in the comments section below. I&#8217;d love to hear what you are thinking._
