It’s my 100
th
 post, so I thought I’d post a hundred things about myself…




1.  I love      the smell of play dough.
2.  I like      to have a night light on in our room at night.
3.  When I      am baking cookies I tend to eat at least half of the dough.
4.  I hate      vanilla ice cream.
5.  I also      don’t like cake, especially chocolate cake.
6.  So,      you don’t think I am crazy, I do have a weakness for ice cream, especially      hand scooped, particularly chocolate peanut butter.
7.  I am a      COKE girl all the way, and not matter how badly I am craving a soda will drink      water if the restaurant only sells Pepsi.
8.  I      detest Diet Coke and would rather drink less Coke, less often, and get the      real thing.
9.  I was      a huge fan of the TV show Alias when it was on and would actually have      dreams where I was Jennifer Garner and could go out and whip up on      terrorists.
10.  If you      actually knew me you would think that was funny b/c I am a big fraidy cat.
11.  Still      in my mind, I’d picture myself with purple hair, and a mini skirt kicking      butt.
12.  I am a      huge, raving fan of Chick-Fil-A and even showed up on cow appreciation day      dressed in cow print with my children dressed as cows, all to get a free      meal.
13.  I love      to watch football, and am a huge fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
14.  I hate      the Ravens almost as much as I love the Steelers.
15.  I      taught 3
rd
 grade for 3 years.
16.  I      tripped when walking to my seat on the stage at graduation after receiving      my diploma.
17.  I      don’t cry when I am happy.
18.  I wish      I did, because I feel like it makes me look like a stoic.
19.  I love      the smell of coffee and begged my husband to get addicted so that our      house could smell like coffee in the morning.
20.  I’m      from Maryland.
21.  I’ve      only had crabs once and when I did I dipped them in ketchup.
22.  Heinz      is hands down the best ketchup and you really can tell the difference      between it and others.
23.  I have      5 colleges on my college transcript.
24.  (2      were from community colleges that I went to during the summer)
25.  I      changed my major twice in college.
26.  I      still graduated in 4 years.
27.  
 
I got married 2 weeks after I graduated      college.
28.  This      was my motivation for taking those summer classes and graduating in 4      years.
29.  I      think TiVo is one of the greatest inventions there is.
30.  I      think golf is one of the boringest things to watch on TV (hmm can you tell      my husband watched the US Open this weekend?)
31.  My      husband and I went to see Toy Story on Ice before we had kids.
32.  I      think we were the only people in the arena without children on our laps.
33.  For my      first date with my husband, he came to my house and we watched the movie      Toy Story.
34.  Thunder      storms scare me when my husband isn’t at home.
35.  I love      holidays and my friend once described my house as like a giant elementary      school bulletin board.
36.  Christmas      is my favorite holiday.
37.  
 
It kills me to wait till the day after      Thanksgiving to turn on Christmas music.
38.  When I      was in kindergarten, I took two color by number papers from school      (instead of one) when the teacher was passing them out and took the extra      one home and told my mom it was homework.
39.  I felt      guilty about this for 3 years and in third grade I confessed to my mom      that I “lied and stole.”
40.  
 
I don’t iron.
 
Ever.
41.  More      often than not I leave the house without having blown dried my hair or put      make up on.
 

42.  I have      a weakness for OREO’s (but only with milk).
43.  I am      truly and literally a steak and potato kind of girl.
44.  For as      long as I can remember I’ve known Jesus as my Savior.
45.  I’ve      only lived in two states my whole life.
 
Pennsylvania and Maryland.
46.  Growing      up my mom was my best friend and I told her EVERYTHING.
47.  I pray      that I can have that kind of closeness with my girls.
48.  I love      to listen to Oldies stations on the radio.
 
I also love to sing along and always think it would have      been fun to grow up back then.
49.  Snakes      and bats freak me out and I will scream like a girl if I see one or if you      tell me there is one nearby.
50.  I feel      the same way about mice and when we had them in our apartment I was that      girl who stood on a chair and squealed.
 

51.  When I      was in third grade I told my Sunday School teacher I wanted to be the      first female president.
52.  I no      longer have that aspiration.
53.  I      drink a glass of milk with chocolate malt Ovaltine every morning for      breakfast. “More Ovaltine please!”
 
(yup that’s me)!
54.  My      husband and I want to visit each of the U.S. National Parks.
 

55.  I      really like hot pink.
 

56.  Little      Women and You’ve Got Mail are my two favorite movies.
57.  I am      afraid of heights.
58.  I love      to go camping.
 
I think being in      Creation away from everything and sitting around a fire eating smores is      well worth all the stuff you have to pack, the walk to the toilet and the      dirt.
59.  I am      horrible at parking.
 
Forget      parallel parking, I haven’t done that since my drivers test, I am horrible      at pulling into or out of a parking spot.
60.  I have      parked too close to the car beside me and had to wait for the person to      leave before I could get out of my spot. (this has happened more than      once)
61.  No, I      don’t drive a Hummer.
62.  I can’t      go to sleep without peeking in on my kids sleeping in their beds.
63.  I can      go to sleep without brushing my teeth.
64.  I’ve      done so more than once.
65.  I’ve      never had a cavity in my life.
66.  I      played with Barbie dolls LONG after I wanted to admit to anyone that I was      still playing with dolls.
67.  I      don’t like to drive and happily take shot gun and navigate almost every      time my husband and I drive somewhere together.
68.  I am      the coordinator for a MOPS (Mothers Of PreSchoolers) group that meets at my      church.
69.  I      played basketball for half a season in eighth grade.
70.  My      coach had to pull me out of the game b/c I made the free throw shot and was      so surprised and excited that I couldn’t stop jumping up and down.
71.  I      don’t like just plain chocolate, as in Hershey Kisses, Hershey bar, or a      handful of chocolate chips.
72.  M&amp;Ms      however are one of my favorite candies.
73.  I also      really like peppermint patties.
 
(also known as Charlie Brown Candy by my son)
74.  I’d      happily eat cereal for breakfast, lunch, or dinner if I didn’t have other      people to prepare food for.
75.  If I      wasn’t “the mom” I would eat the good, candy coated cereal, but since it      is too hard to hide that stuff and eat it in secret, I just buy the      healthy stuff and most often stick to my Ovaltine instead.
76.  I am a      planner.
 
I like calendars and dates      and lists.
77.  I      don’t like Ricotta cheese and when I make lasagna for dinner I always      leave one third of it without the ricotta and my husband knows that when      he cuts the lasagna, the low deflated portion is mine.
78.  My      middle name is after my mom.
 
Sue.
 

79.  I have      one younger brother.
80.  I like      to take pictures, lots of them, often.
 
We have 2 external hard drives because of this.
81.  Nothing      beats warm, freshly baked bread with melted butter on top.
 
Mmmm……
82.  I      gained over 50 pounds when I was pregnant with my son.
83.  I lost      all the baby weight before getting pregnant again.
84.  The      girls were nicer to me.
85.  But I      still have 11 pounds to lose from baby number 3.
86.  (most      of you will hate me for this one)
 
I didn’t throw up once with any of my three pregnancies.
87.  One of      my favorite things to do on a Sunday afternoon is curl up and take a nap      with my hubby while the kids are all sleeping.
 

88.  One of      my favorite flowers is a daffodil because my grandma gave me daffodil      bulbs when I was a little girl.
89.  I’d      rather be hot than cold.
 

90.  When I      sleep I always like to have a blanket on me, but I hate to have my feet      covered.
 

91.  I have      a hard time eating my veggies.
 

92.  I      often splurge on Bath and Body Works soap because it just smells so nice      and seems worth it.
93.  I have      never smoked a cigarette or cigar and don’t ever care to.
94.  I      never drink the last swig or two from a soda can.
 
This isn’t a conscious decision.
 
I guess I hate when it starts to get      warm or flat.
 
This drives my husband      crazy as he has often spilled soda on the floor when he assumed the can      was empty.
95.  My      favorite Girl Scout cookies are Thin Mints (especially frozen) and Samoas.
96.  I love      to sing praise songs.
97.  I had a NKOTB Birthday party once.  My invitations read, "Hang Tough at Crystal's New Kids on the Block Birthday party"  Yea... I was so cool!
98.  Most people think I am an extrovert, but I’m really not.
 
I can be outgoing, but it drains me.
99.  I lam madly in love with my husband!
100.  I was a big fan of Saved by the Bell, Full House, and the Brady Bunch growing up.  When I watch them now, I can't believe I watched them so faithfully time and time again.  Except for Brady Bunch... it's classic... even the made for TV movie reunions.  




Wow!
 
Did any of you stick around to read the whole list?
 
What surprised you?
 
What do we have in common?
 
Leave me a comment… they make my day!
