[![our O fan](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ourOfan.jpg "our O fan")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ourOfan.jpg) Our son is a huge baseball fan.&#160; His team of choice is the Baltimore Orioles.&#160; As much as he likes the Orioles, he also recognizes that they don’t exactly have a winning record…

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Last week we were getting ready for soccer practice when he informed me that he didn’t feel like going to practice. 

Me:&#160; “Well you need to practice, it helps you to get better.”

Son: “ But Mom, I’m already really good.&#160; I don’t need practice.”

Me:&#160; “Even the Orioles practice and their professionals.”

Son:&#160; “But Mom, the Orioles aren’t good.&#160; They need to practice.”

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And in keeping with his very realistic outlook on his beloved Orioles, I thought I’d record this anecdote which I did post on face book a few months ago, but wanted to have recorded.

Son: “Mom, why are the Red Sox so much better than the Orioles, do they practice more?”

Me:&#160; “No, I am sure the&#160; Orioles practice hard.&#160; Well, ummmm I guess they have better players.”

Son: “Why?”

Me:&#160; “Well, I guess b/c their coaches pick better players.”

long pause

Son:&#160; “Mom, I think your wrong.&#160; That just doesn’t make any sense.&#160; Why wouldn’t the coaches pick good players.&#160; I think it’s because they don’t practice enough.”
