Lately I have found myself biting back tears and praying for wisdom as I work with my daughter on obedience and respect.&#160; These battles leave me tired and stretched and yearning for some chocolate chip cookie dough and a bottle of coca cola classic.

One battle area for us has been over her having to wear her [eye patch](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/10/18/i-love-this-girl/).&#160; Seems the novelty has faded and she really doesn’t like wearing it.&#160; I have told her that while I understand that and I know it stinks, no amount of kicking and screaming is going to make it untrue.&#160;&#160; And yet she tests me.&#160; Finally, about a week ago, I sent another of my SOS e-mails to my wonderful husband telling him, I was quite tired of this daily battle and I needed help.&#160; He offered to take over the battle for me.&#160; So each day before he leaves for work he has her get her patch and he puts in on her. 

There hasn’t been a single fight over the patch since he took it over.

Until yesterday when somehow in the crazy morning rush, the patch didn’t get put on before he left.&#160;&#160;&#160; When I had her get it for me, the battle resumed.&#160; After much kicking and screaming, the patch was on and she was sent to her room where she proceeded to scream at the top of her lungs for a good 5 minutes while I sat outside her door praying.&#160; When she came out we talked about her behavior and I asked her why it is that when Daddy puts her patch on she doesn’t scream but with me she argues and screams. 

Her response?

_“Well, I don’t get to spend as much time with Daddy as I do with you and I don’t want to waste that time screaming.”_

I was shocked. 

It was brutally honest and in a sorta twisted way, kinda sweet. 

I then told her that even though she sees me more, she can’t treat me meanly and disrespectfully.&#160; I explained that it wasn’t fair to me and it hurt my feelings.&#160; 

 My daughter and I have had some great heart to hearts lately as we have discussed again and again&#160; respect, self control, anger, patience, and not getting your way…&#160; Some days by God’s grace, I have had the patience to wait out the storms and talk through the heart issues.&#160; Some days I have relied on my own strength and snapped or yelled in frustration and exhaustion.&#160; Both days I rely on God’s grace as I seek to parent my children.&#160; I love my daughter.&#160; I admire her compassion, her competitive drive, her hard work ethic, her easy going attitude and even her strong will.&#160; I just pray that God would enable us to shape that will into one that glorifies Him with her life, and not break that will in the process.&#160;
