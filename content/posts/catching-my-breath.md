Gah!&#160; It seems MORE than a month has gone by since I last updated the ol’ blog.&#160; What a time it was too.&#160; The whirlwind of the end of the school year.&#160; Last week we had our last day at the tutorial followed by their year end assembly.&#160; 

Wahoo!!!&#160; All those snow days we kept our nose to the grind stone are paying off now baby!&#160; 

I was so proud as I watched them get up front and recite all of the things they had memorized.&#160; Latin endings, history time lines, science jingles…. “Yes,” I thought… “They got it!&#160; The DID learn something this year.”&#160; It was a moment of triumph for me as mom and teacher.&#160;&#160; And one I did my best to savor.&#160; Because after enduring all of the whining and tears and frustration and “do I have to”&#160; it was wonderful to see the fruits of our labor.&#160; Today we completed the very last step of the school year, our year end evaluation with the county school board.&#160; So we lugged in our suitcases full of binders and did our best to convey to the reviewer in a short amount of time all the work we had accomplished this year.&#160; They deemed us compliant and we left to check out some library books.&#160; As I walked away I realized all the things I didn’t show them, but they didn’t require it anyway and I realized that there really is no way to full convey all we learned and how we’ve grown this school year.&#160; 

But, in my heart I know.&#160; And truthfully, I’ve seen it play out in these first few weeks of summer vacation.&#160; As we’ve settled into our summer routine and kept up with the reading and math assignments I want them to continue over the summer, I can see growth and maturity.&#160; They no longer need summer reading incentives.&#160;&#160; They eagerly write and mail letters and e-mails to their friends… putting their knowledge to use.&#160; The other night one of them asked if they could keep a journal this summer.&#160; YES!&#160; YES!&#160; This is what I love to see!&#160; I direct the learning all school year, but for the summer, to see kid directed learning is a joy to my mother/teacher heart.&#160;&#160; This is one of the things I love most about homeschooling.&#160; 

We spent our first week of summer break trying to organize the house and establish some summertime routines.&#160; Memorial Day weekend felt like an official kick off to summer… full of watermelon, swimming, camp outs, whiffle ball, cousins, grandparents, and friends.&#160;
