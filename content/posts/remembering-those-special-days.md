Wanna know how to get your husband to remember your birthday, anniversary, Valentine's Day, or other special occasion?&#160; I have a novel idea for you, that has worked well for me these past 7 years.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

_Tell him!_

My husband is horrible with calendars.&#160; His mind just simply doesn't work that way.&#160; Quiz him on the date of my birthday and, given some time to think, he will probably get it.&#160; Ask him how far away that is and he will have no clue (He would need time to figure out which month we were in first).&#160; He just lives each day one at a time and counts on me, his faithful 
PDA
 wife to keep him from missing planned events.&#160; 

I, however, could tell you the birth date of my elementary school friend whom I&#160; haven't seen in over 15 years (can your PDA do that?).&#160; And to top it off, I LOVE holidays.&#160; I continually look forward to the next holiday... we've had Flag Day celebrations and cinco de Mayo dinners... but birthdays are the biggest deal of all.&#160; (With Jesus' birth at Christmas being the number 1 celebrated event at our house)!&#160; [![birthday 2](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/birthday-2-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/birthday-2.jpg)My excitement for my birthday is very similar to that of my 4 year old sons for his own.&#160; I really am looking that much forward to it.&#160; I don't know what it is, but I have always been that way.&#160; I love my birthday and love celebrating it.&#160; I just think it is so cool that it is your day, the day you were born.&#160; (Perhaps this makes me a bit self centered).

Now, I could say, &quot;Well, if he really loved me, he'd just remember my birthday.&quot;&#160;&#160; But, what kind of PDA would I be if I told him everything but the dates I cared about? And what good does that do me?&#160; I know without a doubt that my husband loves me deeply.&#160; I also know that if I didn't mention that my birthday was coming he'd get to the day or or day after and have to enter a date on something and suddenly realize he's in trouble.&#160; Would this make me happier on my birthday?&#160; 

Instead, I tell him.&#160; About a month before I say, &quot;My birthday is in a month.&quot; About two weeks before (right about the time when I know shipping dates for online ordering start to matter) I say something again.&#160;&#160; I actually do the same for him.&#160; He would seriously have no idea that his birthday was only one month away if I didn't start counting down for him in late April (I can't even fathom such a lack of anticipation).

This could seem to some like nagging, but I can honestly say it isn't.&#160;&#160;&#160; I remember our first summer of married life we were about 5 weeks from my birthday and I brought it up (not as a reminder but b/c I was just excited that it was coming up in 5 weeks)&#160; and I said something like, &quot;I don't think your excited enough about my birthday... it's only 5 weeks away!&quot;&#160; This totally made my husband laugh.&#160; 

In honor of my birthday this week,&#160; I wanted to share what works for me with wives who have husbands that may not think in terms of days and months.&#160; **Lovingly** remind him of the day, give him ample warning to prepare, and then enjoy your special day.&#160; To find out what works for others, check out [Rocks in My Dryer](http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/).&#160;
