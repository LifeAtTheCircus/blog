Since you’ve seen [the decor at the circus](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/02/01/superbowl-time/) for the big game, I thought I’d give you a glimpse of the cast members as well.

We had some fun last night, that is FOR SURE!!!

My daughter and her Papa wore their Steelers jackets to church Sunday morning.

The kids had their faces painted for the game to show some Steelers pride!

Great Grandpa snapped a picture of the hang celebrating during half time!

We also took a new family photo.

At the end of the game we woke the two oldest kids up to share in a celebratory sparkling cider toast!&#160;

Some were a bit harder to wake than others.

I got my love of football from my Dad.&#160; I have [many fond memories](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/06/11/daddys-football-fan/) of cheering on the Steelers with him over the years.&#160; It only seemed appropriate to take a pic together on the big day.
