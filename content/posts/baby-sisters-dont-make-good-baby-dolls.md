Last week my two year old wanted desperatly to hold my 9 month old.  This is a practice I don't generally encourage, unless I am trying to take a picture of the kids together, then it's used as a bribe. _Let Mommy take your picture and you can hold your sister_!  This time however, it went the other way around..._Mommy you can take a picture if you let me hold my sister._

Don't they look so cute all lined up in a row?  Do you see the look of pride in big sister's face? []()

"OK, sis your squeezing me a _little_ too tightly!"

"That's it!  I am out of here!"

"Uh-oh, Where did she go?"

At least she can still hold her baby doll.
