This weekend was full of family fun and excitement!&#160; Saturday morning the kids went to the neighborhood egg hunt with both sets of grandparents, while Scott and I went to a wedding reception.

The kids had a blast finding eggs and getting their faces painted.&#160; [![DSC00559](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/DSC00559.jpg "DSC00559")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/DSC00559.jpg)

(some enjoyed the face paint more than others)

That evening (after my son and I got back from a trip to the the after hours clinic where he was diagnosed with pneumonia), we gathered the grands again to dye Easter eggs with us!

Since last year we were [in Texas for Easter](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/04/18/a-great-big-thank-you/), this was the first time my youngest got to participate in egg dying.&#160; Can you tell she loved it?

Don’t you love the intensity in his face?&#160; Check out that tongue!

And my oldest daughter really got into it this year as well.&#160; She was quite pleased with her art work.

Then on Sunday, we had everyone together again for an Easter lunch after worshipping together at church.

After lunch, everyone went home and the circus family all took naps.&#160; Naptime was followed by an egg hunt at home with Mom and Dad and time spent playing together in the back yard and enjoying the beautiful weather.

This year I bought a different package of eggs for each kid… my son had baseball eggs, my oldest daughter soccer ball eggs, and my youngest had sparkly eggs.&#160; Each kid was only allowed to gather their own eggs.&#160; This worked wonderfully because I was able to hide my sons eggs in more challenging locations and my youngest in plain sight.&#160; I will def repeat this idea next year.&#160;&#160; The kids had so much fun sorting and looking at their loot.&#160; And to their credit, they didn’t eat any of it until after dinner when they were allowed 2 eggs each.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; [![IMG_7338](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_7338.jpg "IMG_7338")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_7338.jpg)
