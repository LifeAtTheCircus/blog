[![30th-birthday](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/30thbirthday.jpg "30th-birthday")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/30thbirthday.jpg) If crystal doesn't want me commandeering her blog then she really needs to get a better password ;-).&#160; Yea, this post is actually being written by Scott.&#160; I guess you may know me as the circus dad.&#160;&#160; 

Anyway, as a family we have chosen today to celebrate her 30th birthday.&#160; Yep, the big 3.0.&#160; I’m off all day and we are going to have big fun.&#160; Because she loves you all so much I though her day would be all the more fun if she received birthday greetings from some of the faithful readers she spends so much time sharing her life with.&#160; So, if you feel so inclined, send her a note and wish her a happy birthday!!!

_Crystal, thanks for being the greatest wife and mother any man could hope to be teamed up with.&#160; You really are the greatest.&#160; I am so glad God brought you into the world 30 years ago and I fell a bit spoiled that he brought you to me._


_Happy Birthday Crystal!!!!!_


(P.S.&#160; Not knowing I was going to do this, Crystal did actually wrote a post about peaches last night.&#160; I’m not exactly sure how all your “feed readers” work but if this post pushes it out of your list, you might want to read it too.&#160; Not trying to mess her up.)
