[![image](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/image-thumb1.png)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/image1.png) I  voted today.  For some reason this year more than any other, I was grateful for the opportunity to let my voice be heard.  Often I am rather cynical about it, voting because I know it is the right thing to do but wondering "why bother" and "Does my vote really matter anyway?" 

But today I felt convicted.  

There was a time in American history when woman couldn't vote and there are many countries today where women still can't vote.  And so, I dragged my three small kiddos into the minivan and out of the minivan and through the puddles to sit on the floor and play with their toy race car and plastic yellow duck while Mommy voted.  Because I don't want to take for granted this right I have as an American woman to let my voice be heard.  As a Christian, as a citizen, as a wife, as a mom, it is my duty to take part in the government of our nation.  And as I left with my "I Voted" sticker proudly displayed on my shirt and my kids in hand, I actually got a little teary eyed.  I honestly don't think I ever thought about all the women out there who don't get a say, who have no voice.  

I voted today, because I can, and for that fact I am incredibly grateful.
