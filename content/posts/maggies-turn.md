Being a self proclaimed non dog lover and a mother of three preschoolers, I must admit that the dog is not high on the priority list.  Her needs sadly get ignored all too often.  

I honestly couldn't tell you that last time poor Maggie had a bath.  

But, in the interest of keeping it real, I'd say it was at least last spring.  

So, today I decided to give her a bath.  Trying to bathe a 35 pound dog that doesn't like to get wet in the tub with three kiddos peering over the edge of the tub, is hard enough to do, I could not add taking pictures to the task.   I did snap this one of the tub afterwards though, so you'd get the idea.

And, I was able to snap this action shot while blow drying her hair afterwards.[![IMG_9380](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img-9380-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img-9380.jpg)
