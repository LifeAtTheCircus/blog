Thanks so much for your encouragement on [Monday](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/27/the-agony-of-defeat/).&#160;&#160; I am happy to say that on Tuesday I ran 6 miles!!&#160; My dear husband has given me the gift of 6 songs to download to my MP3 player as an encouragement for completing this goal and to help me as I strive to make it the next 4 miles in the next 3 weeks.&#160; 

Here's where you come in...

I need your suggestions for great running songs.

So please leave a comment with your best running songs.&#160; I hope to download them later tonight or tomorrow so I can listen on Sunday when I do my next long run.

Thanks in advance!
