I am done!

Whew!&#160; What a week at the circus!&#160; This was not one of those stay in your pjs all day and relax by the pool kinda weeks.&#160; 

Not at all.&#160; 

Rather it was one of those, get the kids up, fed, dressed, in shoes (no s[![1 year old loves being on the sailboat](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_9118.jpg "1 year old loves being on the sailboat")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_9118.jpg)mall feat for the circus crew) and to the soccer field by 9 am every.single.morning.&#160; Hello?&#160; Even during the school year, it was only M-W-F for us.&#160; Then after two hours on the soccer field it was time to walk home, fix lunch, get the kids down for naps so that when they woke up (or I woke them this week) we could get our swim suits on and head to the pool for swim lessons.&#160; After swim lessons, we got all 4 of us dried off, changed, back in the car and home in time to make dinner and get ready for whatever evening activity was on our schedule this week.&#160; And this was one of those weeks where we had something every night, be it CPR class for Mom and Dad, watching Daddy sail in Annapolis, or going sailing on Nana and Pop’s boat.&#160; 

[![IMG_9017](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_9017.jpg "IMG_9017")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_9017.jpg)It was jam packed.&#160; SO tight in fact, I don’t think you could have fit another thing in there.&#160; And we didn’t… laundry and grocery shopping were completely foregone and we scrounged by with whatever food I could put together from the back of the pantry.&#160; Thank goodness they got tee shirts at soccer camp… that bought us one day’s outfit!&#160;&#160; 

While I would not want to keep up at this pace all summer, the effort this week was worth it.&#160; The kids had a blast.&#160; They ran hard, laughed lots, made great success in the pool and formed new friendships.&#160; I left the week with 2 new e-mail addresses from mom’s I found close by to meet up with at the park. 

No longer [sitting on the sidelines](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/06/17/life-on-the-sideline/), my middle child got to participate in a soccer camp of her own this week.

This picture right here is a huge deal… HUGE!!

Yup, my son went under water.&#160; Last year he sat on the side and cried about putting his feet in.&#160; Now he can go under all by himself.&#160; Worth [mooning the entire pool for 6 weeks.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/06/16/the-summer-of-swimming/)&#160; 

Not to be outdone, here’s my middle child putting her face in while swimming!&#160;

So, I’d say the stressful mornings and pathetic dinners were worth it.&#160; But I am glad we have a unscheduled week next week to recuperate before Vacation Bible School the following week!
