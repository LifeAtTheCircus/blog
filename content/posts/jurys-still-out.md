I [mentioned before](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/12/13/still-more-questions-than-answers/), that Scott and I have not made any decisions regarding the size of our circus crew.&#160; Some days we feel quite complete with our trio, others there’s that desire to add another little one to the crew.&#160; So, we haven’t done anything drastic and we’re spending some time praying and thinking on it.&#160; But the crew members are starting to share their feelings on the matter.&#160; Not that we asked them their opinion mind you.

Last week the kids and I were walking to the park each holding hands and my son who was in the middle of his two sisters, says to me…

“Mom, it’s not fair that I don’t have a brother.&#160; They both do and I don’t and I want one.

Me:&#160; Well, if we did have a baby brother, he’d be a lot younger than you.

Son:&#160; That’s ok.&#160; I want to teach him things, like karate.

Me:&#160; Hmm… well, there is no guarantee we’d have a boy.

Son:&#160; Oh, well, then you could just have another and we could have 5 kids

(woah, slow the baby train down here… we haven’t even agreed to a fourth)

Me:&#160; Hmm, well, I think it would be hard to fit 5 kids in our minivan

Son:&#160; We could get a bigger van

Me:&#160; Well, with all those kids how would I have time to spend with all of you?

Son:&#160; Well, the baby’s take naps so when they nap you can play with me.

It appears he has this all worked out.&#160; I was left with no arguments, so I believe I muttered something like, “Hmm, we’'ll see…” and left it at that. The girls haven’t felt the need to share their point of view, but I am sure before long they too will voice an opinion.&#160;&#160; He brings it up fairly often though…again this morning when I was scurrying to put on 3 pairs of shoes and 3 coats and scurry out the door to drop my son off at preschool, he said, “Ya know I really want a baby brother and then we could have 4 kids and 2 grown ups which is 6 people in our family.”&#160; Yes, on a day when I didn’t get a shower or even my morning glass of milk, and the girls are heading out with out socks, just sneakers and we are STILL late for preschool, that is an excellent time to discuss adding another one to the circus.&#160;&#160; Jury’s still out…
