Today is my husband's grandma's birthday.  Sadly, she isn't here to celebrate with us as the Lord took her home this past February.   

I think of her often and miss her.  She used to love to bump heads with our kids.  She'd lean forward so their foreheads touched and say, "bump."  My youngest will do it from time to time with me and every time I think to myself, "Grandma would have loved that!"  When the family's all together and I'm serving dessert I can almost here her say, "Hey that's too small a slice!" Certain frilly, pink dresses that the girls wear or bows in their hair remind me of her as I know she'd love them.   And anytime I take the girls out without their socks or shoes on I can hear her scold me as well!  

Every time this song comes on the radio, I think of Grandma and Grandpa and every time I hear it, the tears come to my eyes and start trickling down my face.

They left a rich legacy for their family of a godly marriage and love.  No one could doubt the love they had for each other.   Grandpa is a picture of a gentleman and she was a true lady.  He took care of her every need with love and grace as her health failed her near the end.   Scott sat with them both at the hospital as she died, watching his Grandpa walk his Grandma home after over 60 years of marriage.    Their love is an inspiration for us all.  

How I wish we could serve her some cake and ice cream tonight!


*When I was looking through my hard drive for pictures for our digital frame, I came across the above picture.  It was taken over four years ago at a cookout for my son's baptism.   I don't think it ever made it into a scrapbook, so I'm sharing it with all of you for Kristen's

.   Unlike many of the pictures I share for this carnival, it definitely belongs in a scrapbook.
