Just a heads up for anyone who might care, I won't be posting my weekend thought until Sunday.&#160; 

Tonight I am busy baking and decorating a birthday cake and finishing a scrapbook for my baby girl... we are celebrating her first birthday tomorrow!!&#160;

_**Weekend Thoughts:**_       
_My posts typically relate funny anecdotes about the happenings here at the circus. While my days are seldom &#8220;normal&#8221; enough to leave me without a &#8220;post worthy&#8221; moment, I use my last post of the week to highlight something a little more &#8220;thoughtful&#8221; and significant. If you had a thoughtful post from this last week, or choose to make a new one, please feel free to add a link in the comments section below. I&#8217;d love to hear what others are learning._

_Even though I am not up yet, please feel free to post a link!!_
