Week End Thoughts...  

I decided to move my Thoughtful Thursday since I am participating in We Are THAT Family's Sincerely Fro' Me to You carnival on Thursdays.  Since "Thoughtful Thursday" is something I made up, it seems trivial to move the day... same theme, only we'll call it Week End Thoughts...  

_**Week End Thoughts:**_  
_My posts typically relate funny anecdotes about the happenings of a stay at home wife and mom with three kids. While my days are seldom “normal” enough to leave me without a “post worthy” moment [(i.e. read here)](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/04/29/whats-up-doc/#tt), I intend to take some time on Fridays to highlight something from my week that’s a little more “thoughtful” and significant. If you had a post from this week that was reflective in nature, please feel free to add a link in the comments section. I’d love to hear what others are learning._
