I have been thinking a lot about my grandparents lately and how blessed I was to have them in my life.  I didn't grow up living near them, but all four of them were an integral part of my life.  

My Mema and Pap came to visit us often.  I remember them attending band concerts, sports games, holidays, and birthday parties.  Anytime I was selling Girl Scout Cookies or Joe Corbi pizza's, I could always count on my Pap to place an order and he'd always say, "You eat them for me!"  My Mema could crotchet and she once taught me  

My dad's parents are no longer with us, but my memories of them remain vivid.  They lived on a dairy farm in western PA.  My parents made sure that we visited them often.  I have fond memories of time spent with them on the farm, singing songs with my grandma, eating lunch at McDonalds with them (can't go in THERE without thinking of them)
