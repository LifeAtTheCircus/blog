I LOVE [Chick-Fil-A](http://www.chickfila.com/#home).&#160; I could go on and on about how family friendly they are, how good their food is, how I think Truitt Cathy is such a great example of a godly businessman... but I will save my love affair with Chick-Fil-A, the inventors of the chicken sandwich, for another post, or two...[![enjoying their free food](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/enjoying-their-free-food-thumb1.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/enjoying-their-free-food1.jpg)

Friday was Cow Appreciation Day.&#160; I know this because I subscribe to the Chick-Fil-A e-mail updates and I am in on all things up and coming at Chick-Fil-A.&#160; (See, I wasn't kidding when I said I love Chick-Fil-A). How does one celebrate such an occasion, you may ask?&#160;&#160; Well, Chick-Fil-A offered free meals to anyone dressed like a cow.&#160; 

So, I did what any good mother would do, 
I dressed up
 put my three helpless children in cow costumes and took them to Chick-Fil-A for dinner.&#160;

Their willingness to parade around in public dressed as bovines, combined with the free coupons I had allowed me to feed my family of 5 dinner for only $6.28.&#160; 

We had a fantastic time, eating our favorite fast food and playing on the in door play equipment.&#160; Scott couldn't help but snap a few pictures of our family fun night.

&#160; Mooing for her supper!!

&#160;

A good time was had by all!&#160; My 2 year old didn't want to take off her costume... she went to bed dressed as a cow.&#160;
