I found my 3 yr old like this during nap time today… it seems baby doll has been displaced from her bed.&#160;

It reminded me of a picture I snapped a few weeks ago of both on my girls as we found them when we peeked in on them before going to bed.

YES… they are both sleeping INSIDE of their drawers!

And since I am sharing sleeping pics, why not share a few of my lil man snoozing as well?

What is it about a sleeping baby that just makes your heart swoon?
