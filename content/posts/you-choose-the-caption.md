 Didn’t take many pics around the circus this week, but when I downloaded pics off of my camera this afternoon,&#160; I stumbled across this gem from last week.&#160;

Please help me pick a title.&#160; My brain is a bit mushy this Friday afternoon.&#160; Winning caption gets put at the top of my post!&#160;&#160; I know that’s an honor your all scrambling to achieve, so please… tell me your thoughts and brighten this circus mom’s day with some comment love!

And while your thinking, I’ll throw this one in for giggles as well.
