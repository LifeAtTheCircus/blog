After posting last week's [goofy national park pics](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/11/05/one-too-many-park-signs/), many of you commented that you looked forward to the day we included the kids in these shots.   
Well, wait no longer...  
It only took 18 mths for us to bring our son on his first national park trip.   
Much like the beginning of our first trip, this pose was quite normal.   Here we are in Acadia National Park.

The next summer we had a two and half year old and a 7 month old.  Our son fell asleep in the car after a day of hiking in the park.  Unfortunately, we were only in this park that one day.  So, if we didn't get the sign picture on our way out, we wouldn't have it.  We had no choice but to take our sleeping child out of the car to pose for our pic.  (He stayed asleep the whole time until we put him back in the car seat).

And the next year, we went camping with our 3 and half year old, 1 and a half year old, and 2 and a half month old.    No need for funny poses now.  Getting all 5 of us in the shot creates enough fun poses in and of itself.

He's fast, but not quite fast enough.

The older two had a blast playing while Mommy and Daddy figured out the best place to set up the camera.

This pose was destined for a [Fro' Me to You](http://www.wearethatfamily.com/) post... My husband is straining to hold our middle child while she fights him, I am blinking, and my son is pointing to the sign with such enthusiasm....making sure none of us miss it!  

These next few pictures are from the same trip, but a different park.  [![IMG_6002](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img-6002-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img-6002.jpg) 
My son is checking out the park sign. (Dear son, you will spend many, many moments over your lifetime waiting in front of these signs for us to take our family photo)!

And here another [Fro' Me to You](http://www.wearethatfamily.com/) moment...  
I am sure as we grow, the pics will just get better...though none can come close to [my prairie dog pose](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/11/05/one-too-many-park-signs/)!  
Check out [We Are THAT Family](http://www.wearethatfamily.com/) for the Fro' Me to You Carnival, and many more photos that don't belong in a scrapbook!
