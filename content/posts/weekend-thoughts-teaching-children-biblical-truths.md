Our church has a [catechism class](http://www.gcp.org/curriculum_kids_quest.asp) for 4-9 year olds that meets weekly on Sunday evenings.  This year I will be co-teaching my sons class on the beginning catechism.  Throughout the course of the year he will work to memorize the first 48 questions in the Westminster Shorter Catechism.   

I am really excited about this because the catechism provides an easy way to teach and remember vital Biblical truths.   

For example here are the first five catechism questions.

 

1.  **Q. Who made you?**

      A. God.

2.  **Q. What else did God make?**

     A.  God made all things.

3.  **Q. Why did God make you and all things?**

      A. For his own glory.

4.  **Q. How can you glorify God?**

      A. By loving him and doing what he commands.

5.  **Q. Why are you to glorify God?**

      A. Because he made me and takes care of me.

 

My son knows these and my 2 year daughter even knows the first three questions.  These first three questions are so vital.  From them they learn that they were created by God with a purpose.  And the purpose for each of our lives is to glorify God.   Our family starts each day praying that each of us would bring God glory with our lives for we know that is why He created us.  

The catechism questions are a tool which help us as we raise our children.  One Sunday my son was in one of _those moods._  You know those moods your children get when their answer to everything is "No" and it all comes out in a whine?  As we were getting them out of their car seats he grumbled that he didn't want to go to church.  I looked right at him and asked, "Why did God make you"  He replied "for His own glory."  Right I replied.  "And why do we glorify God?"  He answered, "because he made me and takes care of me."  Exactly I responded, and one way we can glorify God is by going to church and worshipping him even when we don't feel like it because he is worthy of our worship.   

The catechism questions are more than just a list of questions and answers to be memorized.  They provide a practical way to learn Biblical truths and apply them in our everyday life.  I am really excited about learning and applying these truths as I teach my son's class this year.
