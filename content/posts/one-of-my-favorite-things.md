There are lots of things that I truly appreciate about our new house.&#160; Among the top is the location.&#160; This came as a surprise to many of our friends, because at first glance the location seems less than ideal.&#160;&#160; A large majority of our life is centered 20-25 minutes away from our house… our church, our tutorial, gymnastics, and many of our friends.&#160; 

However, one of the most important and integral parts of our family life is located a mere 2 miles away. 

Daddy

Before you raise your eyebrows in confusion, No, Scott doesn’t live 2 miles away.&#160; He lives here with us.&#160; However, his work is a a mere 2 miles away.&#160; And the effect this has on our family life can not be overstated.&#160; 

Scott is able to eat breakfast with us every single morning.&#160; In fact, this week for our “school at home days” we began our school day with Daddy praying and holding the flag for the Pledge of Allegiance.&#160; Then he went out the door to work and we sat at the table to begin school.&#160; I LOVE that he is a part of the beginning of each day!&#160; 

But, it gets even better. 

Two days a week we are at the gym in the evenings… right during dinner hour.&#160; I pack dinner and feed the kids in the waiting room or in the van on these nights and Scott and I eat at home later.&#160; It would seem then that we miss out on family meal time on those days. 

But, we don’t.&#160; 

When possible, (so no, not EVERY time) Scott comes home for lunch on those days.&#160; He can’t guarantee it, so I pack his lunch in the morning just in case.&#160; But when it is within his control, he tries to come home on those days.&#160; He can do this b/c it takes literally less than 5 minutes for him to go from his desk to our driveway.&#160; I have lunch ready, he joins us and he’s back to work within the hour.&#160;

I LOVE it!!!&#160; 

And in my opinion it makes the longer drives to church, school, gymnastics, and our friends houses worthwhile.&#160; 

This week, we had lunch with Daddy twice!
