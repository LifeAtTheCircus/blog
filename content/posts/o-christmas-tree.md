One of my favorite Christmas traditions is cutting down our tree.  I absolutely love having a real tree.  The rush of choosing just the right one to bring home is such fun.  I also really like that no tree looks exactly alike or perfect.  We've had a few that we've brought home and thought...."Ooo, didn't realize it was crooked at the farm."  The imperfections always add to the charm though.

Scott and I are partial to blue spruces.  In my opinion none is prettier, but they do hurt when you touch them.  Scott always strings the light for me.  This year the girls and he did the lights while my son and I were out at catechism class (hence no pictures).  

My job is to put the ornaments on.  We have an assortment of sentimental ornaments.  As I pull at certain ones, I just can't help but smile as I recall the occasion behind them.  

The kids get to put the candy canes on.  They aren't the best at spreading them out evenly.  I don't change it though.  To be honest, I love it this way.  I love that it is their contribution to the tree. The bottom half of our tree has massive candy cane clumps while the top half has them spread more evenly.  One day it won't look like this and I will miss these days immensely.

"One for the tree and one for me!"

Next I string cranberries and popcorn for the garland.  [![IMG_0765](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0765-thumb.jpg)](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0765.jpg) 

The trimming of the tree takes several days at our house.  But in my opinion, it is worth it when we get our final product. 

And at last we have our tree...
