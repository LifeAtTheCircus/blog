One of the things I came across while packing for our move was a bottle of jewelry cleaner.&#160; As soon as I found it, I scrubbed my wedding rings.&#160; As I did, I realized it had been quite awhile since I had cleaned my rings.&#160; As I scrubbed,&#160; the grime became more and more apparent.&#160;&#160; I couldn’t believe how brilliantly they sparkled after I cleaned them.&#160; 

When Scott first came me my engagement ring, I couldn’t take my eyes off of it.&#160; I cleaned it every day.&#160; I would get distracted gazing at it as it sparkled in the sun.&#160; Even as a new bride, a year later, I was still so careful about cleaning it weekly.&#160; Never wanting any dirt of grime to build up and dull my beautiful rings.&#160; 

Now, I am not so careful.&#160; Sure, I’ll take my rings off if I’m mixing up some ground meat or delving into something truly dirty.&#160; But, the day in and day out grime of life seems to slowly cake on them.&#160; And even though I hadn’t noticed, it started to effect their shine.&#160; They didn’t quite sparkle like they used to.&#160; 

And I wondered if there might be a little lesson about marriage as I cleaned my rings that afternoon.&#160; Am I letting the day in and day out grime of life slowly cake on to our relationship also?&#160; Do I take the time to make sure it sparkles?&#160;&#160; I don’t want to take Scott for granted nor do I want to let our marriage dull over the years.&#160;
