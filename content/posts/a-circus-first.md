We’ve had stitches, numerous trips to Right Time Care and even an over night hospital stay, but so far we haven’t had any broken limbs. 

Until this week. 

I was upstairs when I heard the blood curdling screams and sobs of my 5 year old.&#160; I raced downstairs to see her sobbing and holding her beloved Kit in one hand and Kit’s arm in the other.&#160;&#160; (_I had noticed the day before, that her arm seemed wobbly and something wasn’t right, so it wasn’t a total shock to me)_.&#160;&#160; My 5 year old was devastated… “I just picked her up Mom and it fell off… Kit, Kit…”&#160; I held her while she cried and then quickly googled “replacing doll off of American girl doll”&#160; when it brought me to a form to fill out and send Kit in for a “hospital stay” I then went on face book hoping there was a quicker and cheaper answer. 

But, there wasn’t.&#160; I am told Kit will come back with her arm attached, wearing a hospital gown and even an ID bracelet.&#160; (_I didn’t tell my 5 year this part hoping she would be delightfully surprised by this when she gets her back_).&#160; 

She did really well with boxing her up… we&#160; hugged her goodbye, put her in the box, and then took her to the UPS store.&#160;

My 5 year old bravely carried her into the store and gave her to the UPS man (_who was so, super nice, asking the doll’s name, telling her they do a great job taking care of dolls and Kit would be back good as new before she knew it_).&#160; 

Then we walked out of the door and she dropped to her knees.&#160; She was biting back tears and it was so incredibly heart breaking and precious all at once.&#160; I held her there on the sidewalk and then couldn’t resist snapping a picture of her pathetic-ness after buckling her in her car seat.&#160; (I felt kind of guilty for taking a picture of her crying, so I told her I took it to show Kit how sad she was when she left).&#160;

Perhaps that will help the time pass more quickly.&#160;
