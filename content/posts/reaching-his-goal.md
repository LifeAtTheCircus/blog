Tonight I was reminded of the value of hard work.&#160;&#160; For the past two years I’ve had the joy of teaching my son’s [beginning catechism class](http://goteach.gcp.org/ar_catechism.asp?id=987755647) at our church on Sun evenings.&#160; The kids are working through the [The Shorter Catechism Questions](http://goteach.gcp.org/ar_catechism.asp?id=987755647), and by completion of level 3 the kids will have memorized all 150 questions and answers.&#160; 

My son was in the beginning class which covers questions 1-32.&#160;&#160; Last year he came really close to getting them all, but we didn’t quite get them all.&#160; Since I knew he’d be in that class for 2 yrs anyway, I didn’t push him too hard.&#160; When you complete all of the questions , you get a tee shirt as well as a certificate.&#160; 

I had no idea how much that tee shirt meant to my son until about mid way through this year.&#160; As he worked on his questions at home, he’d ask, “Mom, do you think this year I’ll get the tee shirt?”&#160; 

He worked hard and diligently all year and when he correctly answered all 32 questions, the smile on his face could have lit up the room!&#160; He raised his hands in the air and said, “Will I get my tee shirt?”&#160; I couldn’t wait until award night when I would get to present him with the shirt.&#160; [![IMG_7835](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_7835.jpg "IMG_7835")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_7835.jpg)&#160; 

In a way, I am glad he didn’t earn the shirt the first year.&#160; It was incredibly rewarding to watch him work so hard for it the second year and to see how much that shirt meant to him.&#160; It was good to see him set a goal and then work to achieve it.&#160; [![IMG_7860](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_7860.jpg "IMG_7860")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_7860.jpg) 

It is my prayer that as he and his sisters learn these catechism questions, they learn more than just a bunch of questions and answers.&#160; I pray that they learn and apply truths about God’s word to their lives.&#160; I pray that they hide these words in their hearts so that when they are old, they will not depart from them.&#160;&#160; I pray also that they will learn the value of hard work, of not giving up, and of setting a goal and working hard to obtain it.
