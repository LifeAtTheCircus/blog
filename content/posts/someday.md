 Someday when I open my silverware drawer I will find each piece sitting neatly in the slot it belongs. 

Someday my kids wonâ€™t come running when they hear me opening the dishwasher, eager to help put the dishes away. 

And I will look back on these days when my 19 mth old did it all by herself with longing.

So, today I am enjoying the help!
