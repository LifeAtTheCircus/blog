I didn’t really know my great grandparents.&#160; All but one had passed away before I was born and my GG died when I was 2.&#160; I have one fleeting memory of her sitting in a chair in my grandparents dining room, but the rest I get from stories and pictures. 

October could have been deemed “Great Grandparent Month” at the circus.&#160; My children are so blessed to have 4 living great grandparents in their lives today.&#160; We got to spend some special time with each of the great grandparents this month and I am so very thankful that for the memories we made.[![IMG_3696](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/IMG_3696.jpg "IMG_3696")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/IMG_3696.jpg)

At the beginning of the month, Scott’s Nana flew out from CA to spend the week in Annapolis.&#160; Many, many wonderful memories were made while she was in town.&#160;

Later in the month, we went to PA to spend the weekend with my family.&#160; We enjoyed an evening of playing with bubbles at my Mema and Pap’s house.

At the end of the month, we had Scott’s grandpa over to celebrate his birthday.&#160;&#160; We enjoyed cake and ice cream with him as well as time spent reading, playing Uno, and sitting on his lap.&#160;

I can’t say enough how grateful I am for each one of these grand parents.&#160; I love them dearly and am so thankful my children are blessed to have them in their lives.&#160;
