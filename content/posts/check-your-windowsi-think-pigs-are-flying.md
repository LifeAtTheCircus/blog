I can’t explain it, but there is some innate, motherly, 
compulsion,need, 
desire to force my kids to pose nicely in their Easter clothes.&#160; More often than not, this event results in a very patient dad who kindly obliges his wife and tortures his kids, 3 restless and bored children and ultimately a disappointed mom who is stuck with 30 pictures of her kids in their clothes, and yet not one where they are all smiling.&#160; To top it off, we are then late for church… 

This year I decided to try something different. [![IMG_7138](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_7138.jpg "IMG_7138")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_7138.jpg)

I asked Scott if he would mind setting aside some time earlier in the week so we could dress the kids in their outfits and take pictures at the park… I was hoping that by doing it earlier in the week we could remove some of the stress from Easter morning and also perhaps in a relaxed and fun setting, we just might capture a few good pictures in the process.

I couldn’t be happier with the results.&#160;

We got a shot of all three of my children smiling!&#160; 

But wait, that’s not all… we even got some individual shots of each kid.&#160; [![IMG_7070](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_7070.jpg "IMG_7070")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_7070.jpg)

And if that wasn’t more than a mom could every hope for… we even got a few, fun candid/artsy shots as well.

Seriously, I couldn’t ask for more…took almost 3 years, but I finally got the shots of my three children that I’ve been hoping for.
