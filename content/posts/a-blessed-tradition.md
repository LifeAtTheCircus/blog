Labor Day.&#160; What does it really mean anyway?&#160; I’m not fully sure of it’s tradition or reason for existing, but I do know it means a 3 day weekend at the end of the summer and so I’ve never really questioned it. 

It wasn’t until the summer of 2002, that it took on a whole new meaning for me and my family.&#160; That was the year we went to my friends family cabin with 5 other couples and just hung out.&#160; For three days.&#160; Stayed up late talking, played games, ate a lot of junk food.&#160; It was glorious.&#160; And we decided right then and there that we should do this every year. 

And we have. 

Many of you know about our Labor Day tradition.&#160; You come to expect this blog post or the slew of pictures on face book.&#160; 

This year it took me awhile to recap on it.&#160; I’m still not sure I can put it into words.&#160; 

The last few years I noticed a change in our Labor day gatherings.&#160; It started subtle at first.&#160; The original core of our group was the girls.&#160; We were all friends in high school.&#160; _Though I realized this weekend, it wasn’t like the 6 of us all hung out all the time, by ourselves in high school.&#160; But we were all friends in high school.&#160; Good friends._&#160; I don’t think it was until after high school, maybe even after college, that we really grew to what we are now.&#160; I guess that is to say we aren’t friends b/c we were friends in high school.&#160; When we get together it’s not about catching up or reliving those old times.&#160; I think we are such good friends, b/c we are friends now.&#160; Because our friendship has continued to grow since high school.&#160; I do believe the fact we’ve known each other so long, makes our friendship all the sweeter, but its depth and richness come from the continual growth over the years since.&#160; 

Anyway, I remember after our first Labor Day gather how excited we were that the guys all got along.&#160; We were thrilled that this wasn’t just something they tolerated for us, but that they enjoyed and looked forward to themselves.&#160; This is a treasure!&#160; And I think it is a large part of the cement that binds our friendship and our tradition.&#160; There is a mutual love and respect among the 12 adults in our group.&#160; This isn’t something just for the wives.&#160; It is something for all of us. (_and the guys are awesome sports about our Family Olympic tradition and the fact that this tradition is way harder on the dads than the moms)._

Not long after the tradition began, a new tradition began.&#160; It was Labor Day 2003, when Scott and I announced to the group that next Labor Day there would be 13 people attending!&#160; Then it seemed the tradition for the next 10 years was either someone announcing a pregnancy or someone bringing a new baby or both…. in the 13 years since this tradition began, we have gone from a group of 12 to a group of 35! (with promise of a 36th to join us next Labor Day)

And here is where the tradition and the friendship grows even sweeter.&#160; Because now the kids look forward to the trip just as much as the grown ups.&#160; It’s not some weekend with their parents friends that we do every year… it’s a weekend with their friends too.&#160; [![IMG_6134](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_6134.jpg "IMG_6134")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_6134.jpg)[![labor day 2013 320](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/labor-day-2013-320.jpg "labor day 2013 320")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/labor-day-2013-320.jpg)

This year the bigger kids literally played outside ALL DAY… trampsing through the forests… fighting Indians.. making tee pees, enjoying each other.&#160; It was beautiful to see.&#160; Actually, it was beautiful to see the kids of ALL AGES… making memories and solidifying friendships.&#160; even the tiny tots.

As I looked around at our group this weekend, I realized we have grown into something more.&#160; They truly have become an extended family.&#160; And it’s unlike anything I have been a part of before.&#160; I can’t fully explain it.&#160; But, I can say that I am forever grateful for it.&#160; I am grateful for these friendships and our commitment to our friendships and our blessed 3 day weekend together each year.&#160; It is a rare and priceless treasure beyond what I ever could have imagined back in high school.&#160; And I am so thankful that our children get to grow up in this unique extended family.
