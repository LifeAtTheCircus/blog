Last week we took the kids to the local zoo.&#160; We have tried to go once a year for the past several years.&#160; We go in part b/c we want to give the kids a chance to see the exotic animals up close.&#160; It’s so fun to watch their reactions.&#160; But, I’ll be honest, we also go b/c I love to see the animals up close!&#160; It is amazing and awe inspiring and I don’t think I could ever tire of it!&#160; (And I am not even an animal person).&#160; 

Three preschool kids at the zoo in Maryland in the heat of summer.&#160; Why, you might ask?&#160; Well, that I’ve already answered that, it’s fun.&#160; How?&#160; We have a strategy that has 
worked really well for for us
.&#160; We don’t attempt to see it all.&#160; We don’t make it a day long affair.&#160; We pick the few select animals we want to see, we take our time and enjoy them, and we leave happy.&#160; I don’t try to “get my money’s worth” and see every single animal in the zoo.&#160; I feel I get more than my money’s worth by enjoying the select ones we do see.&#160; One year I’d like to get a zoo membership and try to go back often and gradually see them all.&#160; The past two years we’ve been pretty fascinated by the same select few.&#160; 

The polar bears.

And the leopard.&#160;

This year, we had a few exciting moments as we got to feed the giraffe, watch the elephants drink water from their trunk, and watch and listen to the leopard pace and growl.&#160; Because we saw only a few we spent a good deal of time observing them.&#160; We saw more than just these 4 animals, but these were by far the highlight for the circus crew.&#160;
