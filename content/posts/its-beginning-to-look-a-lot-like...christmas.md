Ya know I love holidays...we go all out with food, clothing, decor and not just for Christmas.   I'm sporting the leprechaun hat for St Patty's day, serving up enchiladas and corona on Cinco De Mayo, and partying it up on  

[International Talk Like a Pirate Day.](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/09/22/ahoy-there-matey-2/)  

I was quite proud of myself this week when I finished buying my kids their Halloween costumes.  I mean it isn't even October yet, and we've got the Spiderman, Princess, and Lady Bug bought and hanging in the closet.  

Now I didn't say anything to you all on JULY 3rd when I was shopping for last minute cookout food and saw candy corn for sale at Giant.  

I am not exaggerating, my mom can back me up on this, she was with me.  HELLO... Halloween candy BEFORE the 4th of July?!?!?  

But, I can't keep quiet about this....  

As the kiddos and I were searching Target for trick or treating pumpkins we found 
Christmas lights
 and 
Christmas cards
 on the aisle across from Halloween decor.  

We were just in the first week of fall, and already they are pushing Christmas stuff.  You gotta be careful when buying your candy, you could accidentally purchase red and green candy instead of Halloween.   And what about Thanksgiving?  Stores go from Halloween straight to Christmas.  

I love Christmas.  Truly I do.  But I like to wait until I've packed away the summer clothes, and the leaves have fallen from the trees (or at least changed colors), before I start buying my Christmas cards.  I'm just saying... can't we slow down, and enjoy the season we're in without rushing and pushing for the next holiday down the line?
