Almost every fall, I enjoy taking the kids to the county fair.&#160; We’ve been going since my oldest was under a year old.&#160; This year my youngest was so super excited.&#160; He talked about it for months.&#160; “When are we going to go to the fair and see the animals?”&#160; We went on Friday morning for the preschool preview day.&#160;&#160; Then my parents and I returned on Saturday for the girls to perform a gymnastics demo.&#160; Saturday we brought our cousins back.&#160;&#160;    [![IMG_6450](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_6450.jpg "IMG_6450")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_6450.jpg)  

It was so cute to watch all of the kids interacting with the animals.&#160;

My niece is quite the animal lover.&#160; I loved, LOVED watching her interact with the animals.

The pig and duck races were a favorite event for everyone.

My heart was full as I watched my kids interact with their cousins.. making memories and building relationships… precious, precious times!
