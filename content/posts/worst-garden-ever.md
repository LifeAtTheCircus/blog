It’s time to stop pretending.&#160; The act is over.&#160; Who am I kidding?

I am not a gardener. 

Each spring, I get bitten by a gardening bug and I think that I will turn over a new leaf and suddenly spawn a green thumb.&#160; 

So, I buy some plants and seeds and the kids and I set off to garden.&#160;&#160; Each spring Scott asks why am I doing this when I know what will happen.&#160;&#160; And each spring I assure him that this year will be different. 

The way gardening typically works for me is that I get all excited about it in April.&#160; I weed the garden area, plant a few plants and then pretty much that is it.&#160; 

I don’t eagerly run out to check for sprouts. 

I don’t weed.&#160; 

A lot of times, I don’t even remember to pick the tomatoes off the vine.&#160; 

I am literally a one day gardener. 

The problem is, I don’t enjoy it.&#160; I don’t think it is fun to weed and water and prune the plants.&#160; I don’t wait in eager anticipation to see the fruits of my labor bloom.&#160; I garden out of guilt.&#160; I garden b/c my parents garden and my best friends garden and when they start talking about all their seeds and sprouts, I start thinking, “Hey, I should do that too…”&#160; b/c that’s what good moms do… they dig in the dirt with their kids.

This year started out like any other.&#160; We went to Home Depot, got a few plants and a few seed packets.&#160;&#160;&#160; We also bought some annuals and mulch for our front yard.&#160; Scott and I then spent the afternoon planting and mulching.&#160; When we were done I didn’t feel like tackling the garden so I stuck the plants in front of the house so they could get some sunlight and water and save them for another day. 

OK… that was on April 24th.&#160; 

Here are the plants now. [![IMG_8478](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_8478.jpg "IMG_8478")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_8478.jpg)

Yea… you can see that I got real far on the garden this year…. I think it’s a record… killed em before I even got them in the ground.&#160; The truth is that in my pregnant state there is a limited number of things I feel like getting down on my hands and knees to do.&#160; And the reality is given the choice, I chose scrubbing the baseboards in my bathroom to planting vegetables. 

If that doesn’t reveal my true feelings about gardening, I don’t know what does.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Part of me still has aspirations of planting some sunflowers…we’ll see… but for now this years vegetable garden goes down as my [Friday Fail](http://myblessedlife.net).&#160;
