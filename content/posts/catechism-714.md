_Our good friend Bob posted this on his blog and I wanted to link to it in my Weekend Thought.  Since his blog is for invited readers only, he gave me permission to post it on my blog and link to it that way.  I was struck by the beauty of his poem._  

**Catechism 714**

Of all things  
she wanted to know  
the colors of heaven  

Not the sky  
clouds or stars  
but fit for a King  

Daddy, what will we wear?  
What color clothes?  

Purity  
blood-bought brilliance  

Daddy, why blood?  
Doesn't blood stain?  

Not the blood of God  
God's blood cleans  

How does His blood clean?  

It redeems  
It forgives  
brings peace  
wakes our conscience  

How does His blood brighten?  

God is light  
in Him there's no darkness  
None  
So if we walk in the light  
as He is in the light  
we'll all have peace  
together  
and the blood of Jesus cleanses  
us from all sin  

We must be very dirty  
with sin,  
right Daddy?

God hates sin  
If we say we have no sin  
we are liars  
and the truth is not in us  
But if we tell God our sins  
He won't hate us  
He is faithful  
and just  
and will forgive us  
and cleanse us  
with Jesus' blood  
for without  
the shedding of blood  
there is no forgiveness  
of sins  

Daddy, how many times  
does Jesus shed blood?  

Once for all  
at the end of the ages  
to bear the sins of many  
to put away sin  

Isn't that a lot of laundry, Daddy?!  

Yes, but after He bled  
He sat down  
at the right hand of God  

Is He resting now...  
like when Mommy finishes laundry?  

He's waiting for His enemies  
to be made a  
footstool for His feet  

What does He do while He waits?  

He's in heaven  
with God the Father  
praying for us  

Jesus is praying for me?  

Absolutely!  
So trust Him!  
Don't be scared!  
Be brave!  
Be honest!  
Be bold!  
He is faithful  
We're not enemies  
who shrink back  
to be destroyed  
we have faith  
in Him  
and preserve our souls  

Daddy, I think in heaven  
we will wear white!
