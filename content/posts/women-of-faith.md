During the intro for of one of the speakers at the [Women of Faith](http://www.womenoffaith.com/) conference last month, they asked the speaker what quality she valued most in a friend.&#160; 

She answered loyalty, but my answer was a resounding… 

realness

If you want to win me over/endear me for life, let me see your imperfections… do me a favor, don’t clean before you invite me over…show up to my house for a play date late… with a head full of wet hair… let me see your van full of cheerios and wrappers and those “lovely” Sunday School papers which seem to multiply and grow wings and threaten to over take your car.&#160;&#160;&#160; I love it when I find out I’m not alone… when I realize I am not the only mom who doesn’t have it all together, who meant well, who had good intentions… those people that pull away the façade and bear their imperfections, those are the ones I am drawn towards… the ones I feel a connection with… the ones I want to spend more time with.&#160; 

This year, at the women of faith conference, I felt like the speakers did just that.&#160; 

Ok, so they didn’t exactly get on stage in their snot covered yoga pants…but they did share their hearts.&#160; They told of their fears and their failures… they were honest and real.&#160; And they did it for the glory of God.&#160; They shared of His triumph and hope in their very real, very messy lives.&#160; 

And it was refreshing. 

My mom and I were able to attend the [Women of Faith](http://www.womenoffaith.com/) conference in Washington DC thanks to Book Sneeze.&#160;&#160; Even though Hurricane Irene was heading our way, Mom and I got to enjoy some time away from our everyday responsibilities.&#160; We rode the Metro, we went to dinner, we walked around the city… and we attended the conference.&#160; We were inspired, encouraged, entertained, and refreshed.&#160; And we were led in worship of our awesome Creator God who was, and is, and is to come.&#160; It was a great weekend and I am so thankful for the opportunity we had to go.&#160;
