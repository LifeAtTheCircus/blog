Tonight is one of those nights when I am extra thankful that God has given me a helpmate in life.&#160; And not just any helpmate, but one of the best. 

My three year old was getting on the couch this evening, and if you know my girls, you know that they do this with much exuberance, so somewhere during the twirl she slipped and fell back, hitting her head on our toy box/coffee table. 

I was out at the time and so I received a call saying I needed to come home with the car b/c our daughter needed stitches.&#160; I was already in the car and ready to head home, so I continued on my way. 

My son and I prayed for his sister as I drove home.&#160; 

I can honestly say I wasn’t panicked though.&#160; Because I knew Scott was home and in control.&#160; If anyone else had been with her, I know my Mommy heart would have been breaking.&#160; But, I felt complete peace knowing that Scott was home managing the situation.&#160; 

As I got close to home I called to let him know and to see if we were all going to “the boo boo doctor” (our nickname for the After Hours Doctors)

He said he got an appt for 8:40 and he’d take her and I could stay home with the other two. 

When I got home I gave my girl a hug and Scott showed me the injury.&#160; He asked if I would prefer to go.&#160; He was willing and ready to go, but he was fine with me going if as the mom I would feel better being there. 

 I told him to go.
