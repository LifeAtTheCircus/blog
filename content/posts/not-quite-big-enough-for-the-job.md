As we were walking out the door this morning, I heard my daughter exclaim, “Oh it’s raining, better grab my umbrella!”&#160;

I wondered what she was talking about since we don’t have any umbrellas in our house.&#160; (_Who needs one more thing to juggle? We just get wet, it’s the circus way_)!&#160;&#160; Then I saw her walking to the car with her [Little People](http://www.fisher-price.com/fp.aspx?st=10&amp;e=littlepeople) umbrella over her head.&#160; She then carried this umbrella over her head into and out of the grocery store.&#160; Wasn’t very effective for blocking the rain, but certainly gave this Momma a chuckle on a wet and dreary day!
