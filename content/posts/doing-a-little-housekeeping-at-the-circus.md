Last night I finally got around to updating my [circus cast page](http://lifeatthecircus.com/circus-cast/)….it was LONG overdue and quite outdated, not to mention incorrectly formatted!&#160; Take a minute and let me know what you think of the changes!&#160; 

I had my youngest as the mime b/c when I first created the page, she wasn’t yet speaking.&#160; I am considering making number 4 my mime instead, but don’t know what circus role to give to my third child.&#160; Any suggestions?
