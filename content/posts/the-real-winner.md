To the smart mom or dad who invented the quiet game.

I say, “THANK YOU!”

Seriously, you’ve changed my life…or at least my commute to and from the grocery store.&#160; 

Last week in a desperate attempt to keep my sanity as I drove my three overly tired, overly hungry, did I mention whiny, children home from B.J.’s I remembered this game of my youth.&#160; And given the highly competitive nature of my two oldest, I thought they just might take to it. 

I didn’t realize until a few days later, just how well the game went.

My son was talking to our close family friend and his son. 

“Hey, maybe you can play the quiet game in the car with your dad.&#160; I’ll tell you the rules.&#160; You have to be quiet and whoever talks first is the loser.&#160; If you can go the whole time without talking, sometimes the winner can get a sticker.&#160; You can play it in the car or when you are going to sleep.”

As I reflected on that conversation and on my peaceful car rides since, I have to say I think I am the real winner of the quiet game.&#160;
