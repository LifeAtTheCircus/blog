The Safeway near us closed down for the past year so they could tear it down and build a bigger, more modern grocery store.  I must say I am pretty excited about this because now I don't have to drive as far to get my groceries.  

Perhaps, I got a little too excited.

When I got the flier in the mail about their "grand opening preview party" on Thursday night, I started making plans.  

And, I kinds got the kids
 excited
 brainwashed about it too.  They actually started looking forward to it...."Thursday we go to the grand opening of Safeway, right Mom?"

It was incredible.  There were 5 clowns with balloon art, every where you went there were people giving samples, stickers, candy, there were line greeters, cashiers, and baggers....it was insane... and we had the balloon art to prove it).

When my husband said he'd be home by 6 on Thursday, my response was "Great, you can come with us to the Grand Opening."

He never complained once.  

Not when we had to circle the lot and wait for the traffic directors to direct us to a spot in the parking garage...not when we went into the elevator and it didn't work and after standing in there for 3 minutes we got out and walked up the stairs...not when we got into the store and found it completely bazurk with lines going out the wazoo...and when he asked what I needed I responded, "Nothing, just wanted to see the new store." 

Seriously, not even then.  

We walked around, got samples, the kids had a blast in the cool new cart (good thing we didn't need any food b/c seriously, I don't know where I'd have put the food).

**was the only one complaining..."But Giant had clowns... I wanted you to see the clowns...and Giant had free Starbucks samples...and Giant had way more samples..."

 And then my sweet hubby bought flowers for me at the Starbucks stand, and frappuchinos too b/c "he didn't want me to leave my grand opening empty handed."  Seriously, is he sweet or what? 

 

As we drove home in the foggy rain _after_ the kids bedtime, they were sipping the end of our frappuchinos (come on, YOU try eating dessert right in front of your kids...it's not easy) and saying, "MMM tastes like coffee!" I didn't care that it was after their bed time and we were letting them have caffeine and sugar.  I didn't care that we spent an hour and a half walking around the grocery store to come home without any groceries.  I was giddy because we turned something like a trip to the grocery store into a family event to be looked forward to and enjoyed by all.  (and I even got flowers)!!
