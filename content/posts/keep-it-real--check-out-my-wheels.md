 [Jessica](http://www.farmfreshiowa.blogspot.com/) has a fun carnival where she helps keep us bloggers real.  The deal is you gotta take pictures of the assignment as is, no tweaking for the cameras.  This week she wanted to see "how we roll"  as in what our vehicle looks like.

The funny thing about this is that when I saw the assignment I thought to myself, "how lucky for me I just cleaned the van out last week when we got back from camping."  Ha-ha funny thing is I forgot how much junk a van can accumulate in a week and a half!  

So, take a look inside my minivan.  I took these pictures today as we were heading out for some errands.  Meant to take them earlier this week so I could post this early today, but that's real life for ya...

We've got a 12 pack of diet coke for my hubby that I failed to bring in yesterday when I went shopping...also have baby doll, diaper bag and assorted books and toys to entertain the little ones.

You can see we put the oldest two in the back seats (here they are entertaining themselves with a [Steelers](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/19/star-struck/) car flag and my son is racing a match box car on his wooden gun)  We leave the other middle seat out of the van b/c it makes it much easier to get the kids in and out of their car seats.

And on the other side of the van we have the baby (see her sad little skinned knee)  Note the happy meal box (can't throw it away b/c it has Star Wards on it) and I believe we have some spare clothes lying down there.

Moving to the front seat... I was getting ready to take a meal to someone from my MOPS group and also had a lunch packed for the kids to eat at a play date this morning (see them sitting on the passenger seat)?  On the floor we have a lighter (b/c we went to a cookout the other night) the Sunday paper, a map, some books, [MOPS](http://www.mops.org/) fliers for me to drop off at the library and a roll of paper towels (this was very handy [last week](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/08/20/not-for-those-with-weak-stomachs-that-apparently-includes-my-youngest/) when my baby got car sick)

And my trunk needs to be emptied out before our weekend away tomorrow.  I have some paper products to return to church from our MOPS cookout on Sunday and several huge bags of clothes that my friend passed down for me to use for the girls (I am SO excited about this, we should be set for awhile now)!

Last but not least, the back side... I told you I was a [serious Chick-Fil-A fan](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/15/what-ill-do-to-my-children-for-free-chick-fil-a/)... how many moms do you know with an Eat More Chicken sticker on the back of their minivan?  Yea, I am hard core!

And finally my friends and family will be happy to note that I got around to adding the last fish to our minivan.  About two weeks before my baby girl was born I went out to get "Jesus Fish" for the back of the van.  I thought it would be cute to get one for each member of the family.  Well, I didn't want to put the baby's on till after she was born, then after she was born I was a bit busy what with nursing and changing diapers and chasing around the toddlers.  Then I misplaced the fish.  Then I had to actually wash the van (which I gave up on and instead my husband cleaned the back side a few weeks ago when he gave his car the [once every 3 year wash](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/07/29/bottom-of-the-list/)) (I kid not)!  After many, many jokes from friends, "So, which two kids do you love?"  "What's the baby have to do to get a fish?" and several inquiries from my MIL... today, as I was preparing my real life post, I finally added the last fish.

 

So, those are my wheels.  Not as clean and organized as I'd like, but very, very real.
