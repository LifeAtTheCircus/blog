Each year the Blue Angels perform a show at the Naval Academy in celebration of commissioning week.&#160; Taking the kids to watch the show has become one of my favorite Annapolis traditions.

This one is my sons favorite.&#160; They head for each other so fast you are sure they are going to hit.

These three capture the gist of Scotts favorite trick.&#160; In the one below each plane goes on to do a full 360 loop and they all end up right back where they started.

The whole show is incredible (and free).&#160; We all love the tricks and Scott is always sure to mention what an engineering feet the jets are.&#160; While I have to agree the jets play an integral part, my favorite site isn’t in the sky.
