I am an old fashioned girl.&#160; If you want to get a hold of me, your best bet is calling my land line.&#160; Yes, we have an actual land line (b/c my cell phone is typically buried at the bottom of my purse and the battery is quite often dead). 

My cell plan is simply that - a cell phone.&#160; While I can send and receive texts it costs a pretty penny.&#160; I don’t even want to think about what it would cost me to get online with it.&#160; No twitter or face book updates coming from my phone.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

In fact, I receive texts so infrequently that today when I received one, my son immediately ran onto the back deck.&#160; He had no idea what it was and thought it was a fire alarm (what a good boy).&#160; If that doesn’t say something about the infrequency of my texting, I am not sure what does. 

I have **one** friend who texts me.&#160; Nothing makes me feel more like a middle age woman then when I try to have a conversation with her via text messaging.&#160;&#160; I might be turning 30 next month, but if you were observing me during our exchanges, you would swear I was pushing 60.&#160;

I will no sooner hit send on my carefully scripted message when 30 seconds later I get a good 4 sentence reply complete with smiley faces.&#160;&#160; Smiley faces?&#160; Really?&#160; Where’s she get off with the fancy schmancy punctuation?&#160; 

I then ignore my hubby and kids as I scramble to peck out my response.&#160;&#160; Feeling like a grandma I am completely unable to talk and push the buttons on my phone at the same time.&#160;&#160; And it’s not like she is oh so much younger than me.&#160; I’ve got a mere 2 years on her.&#160; That’s it.&#160; But you would swear it was at least 20. 

How about you?&#160; Are you txt’n like a teenie bopper, dialing like a Grandma, or somewhere in the middle?
