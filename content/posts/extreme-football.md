This weekend in addition to enjoying some [fishing](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/08/18/not-exactly-girlie-girls/) and [campfire doughnuts](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/08/17/camp-fire-donuts/), we also got to par take in some [Pittsburgh Steelers](http://www.steelers.com/) revelry.&#160; While camping is always a good time, the reason for our camping trip was so we could spend the afternoon checking up on our boys in the burgh!

 This was Scott and my third trip to Latrobe, PA to watch the Steelers practice at [training camp](http://news.steelers.com/article/106569/).&#160;&#160; It’s always fun to see the players you watch and cheer on T.V. live and in person.&#160; I particularly enjoy watching them interact with each other.

We met my parents in the parking lot and entered the campus proudly wearing our black and gold jerseys.&#160; My son started chanting, “Here we go Steelers, here we go… Pittsburgh’s going to the Superbowl.”&#160; (Steelers fight song)

As we sat and watched them play we snapped a few (hundred) pics of our favorite players.&#160;

And we sweated, A LOT.

While we downed water bottles and tried to block the sun with our terrible towels, I couldn’t help but reflect on the [last time](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/01/19/ive-had-the-time-of-my-life/) Scott and I watched the Steelers play.

[![2009 AFC Championship Game](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_4646.jpg "2009 AFC Championship Game")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_4646.jpg) 

 Last time it was [27 degrees](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/01/19/ive-had-the-time-of-my-life/).&#160; This time it was 95 degrees.&#160; Seems we’re willing to go to either extreme to watch our boys play ball. 

_(While Saturday was a ton of fun, I think freezing my legs off while watching the Steelers beat the Ravens in the AFC Championship game, still goes down as my favorite)!_
