Last week my oldest son went to a week of Cub Scout Day Camp.&#160; This year he was a Webelos 1.  _I remember vividly his first year when he was but a wee Tiger Scout.&#160;_ &#160; He loves Cub Scout camp.&#160; And who wouldn’t?&#160; 8 and a half hours outside each day, fishing, archery, BB guns, wood shop, specials, crafts…

Each parent is required to volunteer one day.&#160; Two years Scott served in this role, last year I went, but it was the last day of camp and I didn’t get to see as much of the action.&#160; This year I wised up and went on Thursday.&#160; Also known as THE BEST DAY OF CAMP!&#160; My youngest was so, so, so excited to go to Cub Scout camp like his brother.&#160; And since I was a volunteer he could spend the day in the tot lot, gaining his own camp experience.&#160; He talked about it all week and he wore his little camp shirt EVERY DAY leading up to it.&#160; The morning of camp he was up at 6 am ready to go to camp with his brother.&#160; By the time I dropped him off with his leader at 8 am, he was looking so tired, I was afraid he’d be too tired to enjoy the day. 

But, I had nothing to fear, it lived up to all his expectations.&#160; He had a blast.&#160; 

And I did too. 

Top 10 things about my day with my boys at Scout camp. 

10. Sneaking a peek at my three year old fishing for the first time.&#160; Apparently he caught a turtle!

9. When Poe came for a surprise visit to the camp and my son politely sat on the hill rather than pose for a picture with the Ravens mascot… yea, this Steelers Momma was proud. 

8. Learning about Indy race cars from the Baltimore Grand Prix.&#160; Did you know the average pit stop takes 8 seconds?&#160; Seriously, I was impressed.&#160; I learned tons about racing cars.&#160; And being as before that talk, all I knew I learned from the movie Cars… my knowledge grew exponentially.

7.&#160; Learning how to shoot a BB gun.&#160; Granted I never hit the Target.&#160; Not once.&#160; But it was fun to try and to watch my son shoot and HIT the target.

6. Helping my son finish his woodshop craft.&#160; A bug collector.

5. Seeing my boy dirty and tired in the van on the way home.

4. Seeing my little guy follow in the foot steps of his big brother.

&#160;

&#160;

3. Getting a hug from my son in public!&#160; My son who won’t even give me a hug goodnight at home in the privacy of his room, gave me a gigantic hug in public in front of a camp full of boys.&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

(granted it was after he was soaking wet from being sprayed down by the fire truck) But this Momma will take a hug whenever she can get it!

2. Watching my son shoot at the archery range and earn his very first bulls eye!

1.&#160; Hands down, the best part of my day was the visit to the Snack Shop.&#160; Each camper has $10 of snack bucks to spend all week at the snack shop.&#160; My 9 year old was so excited as he took me to the snack shop and said, “Ok Mom, what do you want me to buy you?”&#160; For real… my heart just melted in a big ol’ puddle right there.
