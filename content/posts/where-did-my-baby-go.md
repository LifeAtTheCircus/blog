Something happened to my baby girl.

Seems she was just learning to crawl.

How is that she’s running around, skinning her knees and swinging beside the big kids? 

Didn’t she know she wasn’t supposed to grow up so fast?

She’s my baby.

What is she doing conversing and counting and going on the potty? 

Where did my baby go? 

And who is this pig tailed princess that’s serenading us in the morning with her sweet cherub voice?&#160;
