This morning I was reminded what a great gift forgiveness is.&#160; It was a rough morning… the last day of a very busy week with not as much down time as we’re accustomed to.&#160;&#160; I felt the fatigue that morning with heavy eyes searching for the remote to buy me a few more moments of rest before I hit the to do list.&#160;&#160; I noticed the fatigue in children who quickly burst into tears or whiny screams over rather insignificant things.&#160; 

And then, it happened…

I was busy trying to clean up the kitchen b/c we’re having a new oven delivered and installed today and it seemed having a table still full of breakfast dishes and a sink overflowing as well, wasn’t the face I wanted to present to the world.&#160;&#160;&#160; A temper tantrum erupted, I can’t recall over what, but I do know that my 3 yr old wasn’t just whining she was screaming (a new tactic of hers which I find incredibly annoying)… just screaming at an ear piercing decibel). 

I screamed back.&#160; Yelled at her to stop screaming, STOP SCREAMING, your brother is sleeping… be QUIET… BE QUIET, I yelled. 

Yes, the irony of my response is not lost on me.&#160; 

I sent everyone to a room to chill.&#160; It was only 10am so I knew we couldn’t try for naps yet, but yet,I knew we all needed some space.&#160; So I barked out for everyone to find a room and play quietly ALONE.&#160; 

And as I looked at her face, saw her crying, I knew I had messed up.&#160; I knew I hadn’t handled the situation well at all.&#160; I added to the chaos of the moment, rather than controlling the climate.&#160; 

And so, I apologized.&#160; I looked into those teary eyes and I said, “I am sorry for yelling at you.&#160; You shouldn’t have been screaming and that was wrong, but I was wrong to scream at you.&#160; Please forgive me.” 

And she did. 

Instantly.&#160;&#160; A smile lit up her face and we embraced in a hug.&#160; And I was reminded again what a sweet gift that forgiveness is.&#160; It’s a beautiful thing.&#160; 

We all then enjoyed a little quiet time doing our own things… me dishes, my son Legos, my daughter drawing, and my other daughter playing with her animals…

The morning had been redeemed thanks to a restart.&#160; I called them out of their breaks and we worked together on some more “fun” aspects of house cleaning, the mood dramatically lighter in the circus house.&#160;&#160; In fact, we we got so much done that I went into lunch with a bounce in my step… the house looks MUCH better, the kids were working together and I even tackled a few of those odd jobs that never seemed to get&#160; to the top of the to do list (ie… bleaching out the trashcans).&#160; 

I wish I hadn’t yelled at her to stop screaming.&#160; I wish I had calmly asked her to stop and redirected her behavior without joining in it.&#160; But, I am thankful for God’s grace evident in my family this morning.&#160; Thankful for a chance to apologize and move on.&#160; Thankful for a heart willing to forgive.&#160; Thankful for a break and an opportunity to start over and thankful that when nap time did finally roll around, we began it with light hearts, ready to go take a break, not with exasperated spirits at the end of their ropes.&#160;&#160;&#160; I am thankful for a day turned around.&#160;
