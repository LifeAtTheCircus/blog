A few weeks ago my hubby and I were shopping for a big purchase.   We aren't the type to make big purchases on the fly.  They require lots of research and thinking and looking and more research then finally purchasing.  Cameras, cars, computers, TV's... they're all the same drill.  

But with three kids under 4, it's not quite as easy as it used to be.  

We made two trips to the store in one weekend and I totally felt like a traveling circus.  

As my husband tried to talk to the salesman and look at various models, I kept my eye on the kiddos and wondered why in the world I even bothered to come.  It wasn't like I was really able to concentrate on anything other than my 2 and 4 year old playing catch with my daughter's purse and my one year old running in the opposite direction from the other two, continually.

When I was called in my by hubby for consultation, I did so with a bucking bronco in my arms and the other two bouncing around.  My 2 year old would run up and grab the legs of the salesman, startling them with her huge embrace.  

As we left the store I looked at my husband and said, "This is why I like shopping online."  

With online shopping my husband can do all the research he wants while the kiddos are in the comfort of their own homes, (or better yet their beds) and I can just come look at the screen and listen to the summary.  And my favorite part, they deliver to your home.  I don't have to haul the kiddos out of the house, find their shoes, buckle them in their car seats, unbuckle them, and keep my eye on them in the store.   Online shopping totally [works for me](http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/).  And I learned by trip three to the store, that for times when we can't shop online, we make sure _not_ to leave the stroller at home.  

Before you check out more great tips at [Rocks in My Dryer](http://rocksinmydryer.typepad.com/), take a look at a few more pics of our traveling circus.

My oldest two thought it looked like a race track and my youngest treated it like the "yellow brick road" continually trying to follow the red road away from Mommy and Daddy.

  

We did get a reprieve when the kids found the movies.  They sat quietly looking at the movie pictures for quite awhile.  Doesn't my son look pathetic as he lays on the floor in complete boredom waiting for Mommy and Daddy to finish?
