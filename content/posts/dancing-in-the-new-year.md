This year we celebrated New Years in two parts.&#160; We did a family fun night with the kids concluding at 8 with followed by a date night with the two of us to officially ring in the new year.&#160;

Here are some pictures of my son cutting it up on the impromptu dance floor in our living room.&#160; He was having a blast, as I am sure you can tell.
