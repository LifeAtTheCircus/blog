She’s been wiggling that tooth for weeks now… hoping and hoping it was ready to pull.&#160; I could see the tip of the new one peeking through behind it so I figured it was time for it to come out. 

Daddy always does the honors round here, so she sweetly begged Daddy to pull it this morning before leaving for work.&#160;

Part way in Scott realized that maybe that tooth wasn’t as ready to come out as we thought.&#160; But, she was determined and truly didn’t flinch once.&#160; I was crazy impressed as it took a lot of pulling and wiggling.&#160; She never wavered in her resolve and we realized something about our third born child this morning.

When she sets her mind to something, she goes after it.&#160; She has much more mental strength and toughness than we realized… truly more than I saw from her older two siblings when their teeth had to come out.

Our baby girl is growing up!
