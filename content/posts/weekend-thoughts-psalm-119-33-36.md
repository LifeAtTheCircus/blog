I am afraid I don’t have much for you this weekend in terms of deep thoughts.&#160; But I did stumble across this passage of Scripture.&#160; Doesn’t it make a wonderful prayer for us to offer up to our Lord?&#160; I am particularly challenged by verse 36.&#160; Oh, that I would turn my heart towards God’s statues rather than my own selfish gains.&#160; Teach me Oh God.&#160; 

_Psalm 119:33-36_

_
33
 Teach me, O LORD, to follow your decrees;         
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; then I will keep them to the end._ 

_
34
 Give me understanding, and I will keep your law         
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; and obey it with all my heart._ 

_
35
 Direct me in the path of your commands,         
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; for there I find delight._ 

_
36
 Turn my heart toward your statutes         
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; and not toward selfish gain._
