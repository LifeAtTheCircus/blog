Those of you with more than one kiddo know how insanely difficult it is to get a good picture of all your children **_together_**….if you don’t know what I am talking about, check out [this post](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/10/08/those-pesky-alumni-shots/) or [this one](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2008/11/19/if-only/), and you will get an idea of what I am referring to.&#160; You have aspirations of all three children sitting still, smiling, and looking at the camera.&#160; After about 30 clicks of the camera and at least 20 begs and pleas to “look at mommy” and “please sit down” you suddenly set your sights a bit lower and just hope for all of them smiling… who cares where they look and how they sit….

After an almost 3 year quest for that perfect picture of our children together, we finally got it.&#160; (we got really close this Easter with our [“best group shot yet”](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/03/31/check-your-windowsi-think-pigs-are-flying/) picture) 

On our way to the hospital to have our fourth child, Scott decided to quick snap a picture of the kids as we dropped them off with Great Grandpa.&#160; He told the kids to smile really nice b/c this was the last picture we’d have of our children, when it was just three of them.&#160; 

Apparently, that was all it took b/c they totally turned on the charm and Scott clicked away.

Of course we get that sought after picture of our kids together only to have it become completely outdated a mere 5 hrs later!

And if the secret to getting a good picture of all of my children together&#160; requires me to be in labor for their next sibling, then I am pretty much guaranteed, to never have a good picture of the 4 of them together.

Oh well… it was good while it lasted!!
