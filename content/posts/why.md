Last summer I took a Sunday School class in which&#160; I was introduced to a concept called solidarity and I realized I had very little of it.&#160;&#160; Before that class I was really very uneducated and honestly uncaring about events and situations going on in other parts of the world.&#160; If a plane crashed in Illinois, I’d be all over cnn.com reading the footage and following the case.&#160; “How tragic,” I’d think.&#160; But if I read of a plane crash in Mongolia, I am pretty sure I wouldn’t even click on the link.&#160;&#160; Why?&#160; Why do I care more about the fate of fellow Americans than of those in another continent?&#160; As a Christian, I should care a great deal about the suffering of any fellow human being. 

[While in DC](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/06/22/shh-dont-tell/) last week, we saw this quote on a world war II memorial near the capital building.

As I read it, I couldn’t help but think about the fact that despite all we learned from the Holocaust, similar events are going on in the world with very little being said or done about it. 

I can remember when I was in school and I read of the horrific events which took place during the Holocaust, I kept wondering why it took so long for America to get involved.&#160; “Why,” I’d ask.&#160; “Why didn’t we do more?&#160; Why didn’t we care?&#160; Why did we wait until Pearl Harbor before we stepped up and ended it? “

And I can’t help but wonder why, despite all we learned, and despite all we have as Americans, are we doing so little now for the hundreds of thousands of people in Uganda and Darfur who are suffering and dying due to extreme acts of violent genocide and complete starvation?

Why aren't we “mobilized” on this?&#160; Why does it seem that Hollywood cares more about the hundreds of thousands of people be murdered in Africa than evangelical Christians?&#160;&#160; 

Why?&#160; What will it take?&#160; Surely there is something I can do to ease their suffering.

That’s what I am pondering this weekend.
