We are on break here at the circus.&#160; And I couldn’t be more excited about it.&#160; I have been looking forward to this week for ages.&#160; The week before Christmas.&#160; All I want to do is enjoy the kiddos and catch up on some house work.&#160; And bake.&#160; And do some shopping.&#160; And maybe see some friends.&#160; _(ha, ha… can you tell I am an introvert?&#160; read over that list, when I proof read this and re read it, it made me laugh)…_ 

Well yesterday was rough.&#160; We had a fun filled family weekend that left us all tired.&#160; Mom was tired.&#160; The kids were tired.&#160; I let them watch too much tv and play too many video games which left us all grumpy.&#160; I attempted a craft but it was way harder than I thought and ended up more frustrating than fun for all of us.&#160; Except the 3 year old.&#160; He loved it, which truthfully provided some sense of accomplishment to this tired and frustrated Momma. 

But, today is a new day.&#160; And even though I am still in my pjs at 2:30… and that bread dough I started 3 hours ago is still sitting half done on the counter waiting for me to grind more flour, I feel like more has been accomplished and we are all happier.&#160; We started the day with words searches instead of tv. I got a few loads of laundry washed and FINALLY washed those dishes that have been piling up in my sink since Saturday.&#160; (Yes, you read that correctly, SATURDAY)&#160; It felt good to get to the bottom of that pile.&#160; Toilets were scrubbed, kitty litter emptied and mirrors washed, thanks to the kiddos. 

They still played video games, and are playing again now, but we also painted some wooden trees.&#160; These were a HUGE hit.&#160; They loved these and it made my heart smile.&#160; I don’t do art enough with them.&#160; In the scramble to accomplish nouns, verbs, division, times tables, Latin, history timelines… well art often gets pushed to the back burner.&#160; I know it’s wrong.&#160; I struggle with art guilt all quarter long.&#160; But today we had no jingles to sing, no worksheets to do, and so we painted.

and we smiled

And I loved it.&#160; Loved every minute of it.&#160; 

I LOVED every layer of color on my 3 year olds tree.

I can’t wait till they dry and I can set them up on my fire place mantle.&#160; I love how different each one is and I love how I can see their personalities shine through in each one.&#160; 

_Oh, art… I must find a way to squeeze you with the flashcards and timelines, because you are so, so good for the soul._
