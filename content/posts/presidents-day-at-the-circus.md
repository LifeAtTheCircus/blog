Can I make a little confession?&#160; I was going to skip Presidents Day… truthfully, it’s a holiday that I’ve only really given a nod to in the past, no real hoopla.&#160; And this year it falls right before Fat Tuesday and the end of Mardi Gras… _Mardi Gras is another holiday I’ve skipped in the past but for some reason this year I decided to educate the kids on New Orleans food and culture as well as jazz music…_ (I think it’s b/c of these [Family Fun magazine recipes](http://familyfun.go.com/sitesearch/results/q=*;q1%253dmardi%2520gras%253bx1%253dholidays/?type=link))…

Anyway, I was all set to celebrate Mardi Gras on Presidents Day this year b/c we are off school on Presidents Day and Tuesdays are crazy busy with school at home, piano lessons, and gymnastics…

But, then my son mentioned to me yesterday (after we had already left Aldi’s mind you)&#160; “Mom, didn’t you say you were going to make cherry pie for Presidents Day?”&#160;&#160;&#160; oh right…. I did…. IF ONLY HE HAD MENTIONED THAT AN HOUR EARLIER WHEN WE WERE AT THE STORE….

so… I shuffled around my Mardi Gras plans… and brought the presidents back to Presidents Day…. thanks to 1. [Pinterest I found a cute craft](http://pinterest.com/pin/242701867388674479/)&#160; 2. [this year’s Halloween Costume](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2011/10/31/halloween-riddles/) we even had General Washington make an appearance… and 3. 
2 additional trips
 to the store (b/c when I went back to Aldi’s on Monday they were out of pie crust)…. we had ourselves a President’s Day celebration….

(FYI the picture I saw on Pinterest used cotton balls for George’s hair but we were out, so we used toilet paper instead and I actually like the end result better)

Look who I caught later trying to sneak himself another piece of pie….
