....Flushed Poop.....  

Yes, you read that correctly and if bathroom talk/humor is not your thing, then I suggest you skip this post.  

The following incident actually occurred in my house today.  Sometimes I wonder, "What will I write about in my blog today?"  Or I worry if I will have enough stuff to write about to keep blogging far into the future... then things like this occur, and I think, "Well, that's today's post!"  

After going potty this afternoon, my son excitedly called me into the bathroom.  

"Look Mom, my poop looks like Mickey Mouse!"  

(It actually did, big ball with two little balls on top..)  

"That's cool honey,"  I replied, then I wiped his butt and did the unthinkable....  

I flushed the toilet.  (What WAS I thinking, this was a work of art here!)  

The tears came, "Mommy, you flushed the toilet!"  

uh-oh  

"I wanted to show Daddy!"  (clearly poop like this NEEDS to be shared with the world)  

I instantly got down on his level, looked him in the eye and apologized.  I didn't realize he hadn't shown Daddy yet.  (Who would've thought that one day I would be asking forgiveness for flushing poop down the toilet?)  

Daddy came in the room then and was quickly filled in on the situation.  His response, "Don't worry bud, maybe you'll make mickey mouse poop another time and I can see it then."   (We encourage our children to truly strive for the best in life, push them to the highest levels...)  It was all I could do not to laugh out loud right then.  

I don't know if poop like this comes around twice, but if it does I will be sure NOT to flush before everyone in the house sees it first!
