Scott and I got away last week, just the 2 of us, for 3 nights in the Windy City.&#160; It was a belated 10 year anniversary gift to ourselves.

And it was WON-DER-FUL!!

The city of Chicago is beautiful.&#160; The buildings are unique and interesting… truly works of art in and of themselves.&#160; We had so much fun walking around the city and taking in its beauty.&#160; 

The weather was overcast and it rained off and on while we were there.&#160; But, thankfully, we were able to enjoy a gorgeous evening observing the skyline at the Navy Pier our first night.&#160;

We had a great time at the Art Institute of Chicago.&#160;&#160; One of my favorite dates with Scott is going to the art museum.&#160; We have fun looking at different paintings… picking our favorite in each room, or picking the one we’d hang in our house if we had our choice.&#160;&#160; It might surprise you to know that Scott’s favorite is always modern art.&#160; _Before we were married, I’d never have pegged him as a modern art guy._&#160; (I know this picture isn’t of modern art…but it was our favorite picture in that room, and I liked the picture of Scott observing the painting).&#160; We also attended the symphony, another rare treat for us.&#160;

The clouds parted and the sky opened in time for us to head to the top of the Willis Tower (formerly called the Sears Tower)… the highest structure in the U.S.&#160;&#160;&#160; You might recall I am not a big fan of heights…but I didn’t want to miss out on the adventure.&#160;

So glad I didn’t… how cool is it to kiss the man of your dreams at the top of the world?

We did lots of walking… lots of talking… shopping…eating… there was no schedule.. no place we had to be… no demands… just time to enjoy my best friend all to myself.&#160; And I did… every minute of it.
