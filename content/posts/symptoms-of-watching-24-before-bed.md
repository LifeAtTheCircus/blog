Scott and I enjoy watching those “thrill drama series” such as [24](http://www.fox.com/24/), [Alias](http://www.alias-tv.com/), [Heroes](http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/)…&#160; I can remember when we would watch Alias, I would often have dreams where I would save the day with my mean back side kick and my “kickn” purple air.&#160; Ya, if only…

Well this morning I woke up and told Scott I had the strangest dream.&#160; In part of it we were going away for our honeymoon only it wasn’t really because we already had the kids and we were staying in this hotel like room underground in my parents yard.&#160; A safe house perhaps?&#160; 

Things are a bit foggy as dreams usual are, but I vividly really being at a school and figuring out that there was a terror plot underway for bombs to go off in every school across America when they said the pledge.&#160; Apparently, all the schools in America pledge of allegiance at exactly the same time every day.&#160; I was trapped but somehow was able to secretly text a message which said, “no pldge” and somehow whoever received this message understood and was able to stop the terror plot.&#160; I have a fuzzy recollection of agents bringing the bombs out of the school buildings across America…none of them able to go off since they children never said their pledge.

Back to my romantic getaway.&#160; Before leaving for our “safe house” I recall telling my parents, “Only call us if there is a problem with the kids or a matter of national security.”

Yea because in matters of national security people always turn first to Crystal, stay at home mom.&#160; 

Hmmm, guess you can’t tell what I watched last night before bed?
