A few weeks ago my FIL approached me about running in a local half marathon with him at the beginning of March.&#160; Because I seem to require a race to motivate me to run, I was eager to accept.&#160; However, it only left me about 7 weeks to prepare and I was not in running shape, having only run a handful of times since my son’s birth last June.&#160; 

I found some training guides online (both of which suggested 12 weeks to prepare) and spent a good amount of time face booking and e-mailing with a friend about my strategy.&#160; I’ve pretty much settled into 2 short runs a week and one long run on the weekend, with the distances for both increasing each week.&#160; This week my short runs are 4.5 miles and my long run will be 7 miles.&#160; By the week prior to the race I will be up to 10 miles for my long run and I believe 5 miles for my short runs.&#160;&#160; 

This is the first time I have trained for a race using a treadmill.&#160; I know it isn’t exactly like running on the road, but I do believe it is pushing me to run faster.&#160; And let me set the record straight, my fast is a mere 5.0mph, which equals a 12 mm.&#160; 

Last week however, I sorta fell off the wagon, or the treadmill and managed to skip all 3 runs… I could list for you my many excuses for why, but they all boil down to just that, excuses,&#160; so I will spare you. 

Tuesday, it was time to get the sneakers back on and get back on track… after completing my 4.5 mile run, I was left with a few thoughts…

1.&#160; Why have I not run using the TV on the treadmill before?&#160; I can’t believe how much more enjoyable the run was thanks to Gilmore Girls on DVD…especially compared to merely staring at the numbers on my treadmill.&#160; 

2.&#160; Skipping a week of running was a big mistake.&#160; My legs were jelly when I finished.&#160; Jelly

3.&#160; Is there any chance I can bring Gilmore Girls with me for the 1/2 marathon? (any volunteers to run ahead of me with a portable dvd player strapped to their back)&#160; 

4.&#160; I wish the race was the beg of April instead of the beg of March.

I have 4 weeks left to go… I hope to be better prepared than [my last big run](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/08/30/this-sounded-like-a-good-idea-3-months-ago/) and at least finish [knowing I did my best](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2009/09/04/weekend-thoughts-im-a-survivor/).
