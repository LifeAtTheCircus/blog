Timely, we are not.  

But we do follow through…eventually.  

We promised our daughter on her third birthday in early Feb, that her gift from us would be a special trip with Mommy and Daddy to make her own teddy bear.  

Two months later, the magical moment happened.  

After dropping her siblings off at Nana and Pop’s, Scott and I realized this was the first time we had spent time, just the three of us, since she was in the hospital three years ago!  

Here she is putting a heart into her new dog, Biscuit.[![IMG_5137](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/img-5137-thumb.jpg "IMG_5137")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/img-5137.jpg)  

Then she and Daddy washed him off at the bath tub.  (This was by far her favorite part of the event, she went back over here numerous times to clean him up).

Her new friend!

Then she thought Mommy should have a turn at the cool bath tub, while SHE took a picture!

A good time was had by all!  Nothing like stretching things out a bit and making her birthday last a bit longer!
