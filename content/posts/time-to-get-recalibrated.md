Check out the size of these diapers!! Have you seen anything so little?&#160; It’s been a long time since we’ve had diapers that small around here… I think I forgot how tiny they were.&#160;

Seriously, my hand is bigger than the diaper!!

Granted my swollen hands are bigger than a lot of things these days so maybe that wasn’t the best bench mark, but still….what a tiny little bottom we’re going to be wiping soon!!
