My son has always had a very inquisitive nature.&#160; When I was pregnant with my third child, he was three.&#160; He fully grasped the concept that there was a baby in my belly.&#160; But, what he wanted to know was, how the baby was coming out.&#160; At first I tried with vague, non specific responses.&#160; But they weren’t doing it for him.&#160; He kept bringing it up, again and again.&#160; Then he started to get worried.&#160; “Mommy, how will the doctors get the baby out of your belly?”&#160; “Will they cut you up?”&#160; Finally, after hemming and hawing several times over the course of several weeks, I told him that God gives Mommy’s a special hole for the baby to come out.&#160; 

This of course didn’t help to dispel his curiosity.

He then wanted to see it.&#160; Which, of course, I told him he couldn’t.&#160; I explained it was a special hole and it didn’t really open up until it was time for the baby to come out.&#160; 

This seemed to satisfy him and the conversation wasn’t mentioned again.&#160; 

A little over a month later, my baby girl was born.&#160; Shortly after she was born, the kids were invited into the room to see their baby sister.&#160;

They were so excited to see her.&#160; They looked at her and said hello.&#160; While still in my husbands arms, before even a full minute in the presence of his new sister he turns and looks across the room at me sitting in the hospital bed and asks,

I’m telling you. This kid stays on top of things.&#160; He doesn't just ask questions to ask questions.&#160; He really wants to know.&#160; And persistent too.&#160; This story provides the much needed background for Friday’s post entitled “Eggnog Talks.” Be sure to come back tomorrow to hear the first of two conversations had between my husband and my son as they sip eggnog (aka” the talking/sipping drink” at our house).&#160;&#160;
