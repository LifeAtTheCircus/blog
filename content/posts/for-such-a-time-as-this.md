There are all kinds of people in the world.&#160; Some morning people, some night owls.&#160; I truly think your propensity towards one or the other is an inborn part of your personality.&#160; True, you can work on becoming more of a morning person (and society pretty much dictates this to some degree), ones natural inclination, I think,&#160; is innate. 

For a glimpse of this, one must simply observe my two daughters. 

Both raised in the same household, by the same parents.&#160; Both even sleep in the same room and go to bed at the same time.

Both, however, do note wake up the same way.&#160; 

Take this morning as a very typical example.

My three year old woke first and appeared in the dining room with a smile on her face.&#160; She instantly asked for Cheerios and chocolate milk (as she does every morning) and as I got them for her she began chattering to me about the birds she heard singing out of her window.&#160; 

While I set about cleaning the kitchen and packing Scott’s lunch she eagerly began coloring a picture in her coloring book.&#160; She does not need any time to wake up or adjust.&#160; She wakes up, “On” and ready to seize the day. 

Thirty minutes later her sister appeared in the dining room.&#160; Her eyes are barely open, a literal snarl on her face, and while she is standing in our dining room, she is by no means awake yet.&#160; When she wakes up, she doesn’t want to talk, she merely wants to crawl in Mom or Dad’s lap and sit.&#160; 

It’s a wonderful time for snuggling if you seize the opportunity.

About 10 or 15 minutes after she appeared in our dining room she utters her first word, “banana”.&#160; 

I can tell she is going to be my coffee drinker.

After eating her banana and sitting on Daddy’s lap for a good 15 minutes, she is ready to climb down and face the world. 

While I have known she is not a morning person for awhile now, I have not figured out the best way to get her up and dressed on the mornings we need to get out the door by 8 am.&#160; 

In my ignorance, I have let her sleep as long as possible with the hope that she will wake on her own and thus wake in a better mood.&#160; Only recently, have I realized the folly in this approach.&#160; Even if she wakes on her own, she still needs at least 15 minutes before she can start thinking about moving along.&#160; If I let her sleep until 7:45 or worse yet, if I WAKE her at 7:45, it is only going to be a battle of epic proportions to get her dressed and out the door in 15 minutes.&#160;&#160; I know b/c I tried this for weeks on end and it was not a pleasant start to the day.&#160; Recently, we learned that if you wake her up earlier, give her time to sit and snuggle, eat and THEN prompt her to get dressed and ready, she is much more amicable.&#160; 

Hmm…. is it actually better for a non morning person to wake up earlier rather than later? 

This is interesting. 

This week I tried the same approach on myself.&#160; I would attest that Scott nor I are morning people.&#160; And as such, our most productive time of day seems to be late at night.&#160; Mornings we like to sleep in as late as possible than race around the house to get everyone out the door.&#160; We often run late in the mornings.&#160;&#160; 

Yesterday my youngest woke at 5:30. 

A.M.&#160; 

I decided to go ahead and feed him so that he would be fed and set until after we got home from dropping his brother off at the tutorial.&#160; 

I then decided that since we had no bread in the house for breakfast or lunch, that perhaps I should just stay up and make some.&#160; Thank you [Sarah,](http://grshortstop.blogspot.com/) for your quick [beer bead recipe](http://grshortstop.blogspot.com/2009/10/homemade-beer-bread.html), which doesn’t need time to rise.&#160;&#160; With the bread in the oven, I decide to go ahead and work on my homework for [Bible study](http://www.lifeway.com/lby/lby_about_study/0,2200,,00.html), which I was dreadfully behind on.&#160;&#160; Then, it was 7 am and I hopped in the shower.&#160; 

I have tried setting my alarm and rising early in the past.&#160; I typically hit snooze and roll over till the last minute possible.&#160; I think, much like my 5 yr old, I need time to wake up.&#160; I can not wake up and hop in the shower.&#160; I need to come out, sit on the couch, read a little facebook, grab a cup of coffee, sit on the couch and do my quiet time, AND THEN shower and get ready to start the day.&#160; 

I don’t know how long I can keep this up.&#160; Old habits die hard and I am not one to rise early and meet the sun.&#160; BUT, I will say that the last two mornings I have greatly enjoyed the time of quiet to prepare the kitchen, the house, and my heart, for the day ahead.&#160;&#160; I like starting the day feeling like I am some what ahead instead of racing around feeling rushed and guilty and very much like _that mom_. _(Ya know the one with all the kids who is never on time and didn’t even shower or put together a somewhat respectable outfit)._ 

Perhaps [my switch to the dark side](http://lifeatthecircus.com/2010/09/29/my-switch-to-the-dark-side/) this fall was a preparation for such a time as this…
