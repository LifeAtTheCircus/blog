[![IMG_4673](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-4673-thumb.jpg "IMG_4673")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img-4673.jpg)Scott and I were in our seats by 4:45.&#160; We were too excited to stay away any longer.&#160; When we looked out into the stadium, it was obvious who the non season ticket holders were.&#160; There was a sprinkling of us around the stadium.&#160; Rookies eager to enjoy every precious minute of the event.&#160; 

 As we sat down in our seat (only three rows back in the upper level) we could see everything!!&#160; I looked over to Scott and said, “I think I just found a way to be discontent with our big screen TV.”&#160; 

The temperature was in the twenties and then the teens.&#160; We came prepared though.&#160; I was wearing…

3 layers of pants

4 layers of shirts

1 military issue arctic condition coat borrowed from my FIL

2 pairs of gloves

3 socks

1 stadium blanket

1 pair of boots (one of which lost its sole)

3 hand warmers

4 foot warmers

&#160; I’ll be honest.&#160; My hands and toes were cold.&#160; And I could feel the wind on my face.&#160; But otherwise I was really fine.&#160; I’ve been colder than that running to my car and driving to preschool in the morning.&#160; Amazing what layers can do…and emotion and adrenaline help too.&#160; 

&#160;

Highlights for me included:&#160; 

*   watching Ben scramble out of the pocket, throw a pass to Holmes and then watching him run across the field, follow the blockers and score a touchdown… it was amazing to watch the entire play come together!
*   getting to see a Polamalu interception returned for a touchdown was a dream come true.&#160; Our seats were on the 20 yard line so we saw that touchdown right before our eyes.&#160; Scott and I were jumping up and down screaming like crazy.
*   watching the defense take a stand… man I’ve heard of the power of the 12th man, but to be a part of it was something else…seeing our number 1 defense hold them to no first downs in the first quarter and keep them under 200 yards for the entire game was awesome.&#160; Hearing the crowd go wild when the defense was on the field was truly awesome!&#160;
*   And then the rumpus after we won.&#160; We’re hugging perfect strangers, high fiving… more jumping…dancing in the aisles, singing, more dancing…it was incredible!&#160; Pittsburgh’s going to the Super bowl!!!!  

&#160;

We truly had the time of our life and didn’t want it to end.&#160; We even stopped at Eat-N-Park on our way home just to make the night last a little longer (yea I got a few stares in my face paint…somehow removed from the celebration of the event, you look more ridiculous…but I didn’t care… We’re going to the Super bowl Baby and I watched them get there!”
