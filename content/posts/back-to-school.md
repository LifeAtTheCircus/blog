Because our homeschool tutorial meets on a Mon-Thurs schedule and the board doesn’t like to start the year on a partial week, we are THE LAST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD (or so it feels like) to start back to school.&#160; But, today we finally had our turn for the morning poses on the front step.&#160; [![IMG_6328](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_6328.jpg "IMG_6328")](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_6328.jpg)

Another school year is upon us.&#160; We had an EPIC summer.&#160; One for the record books… and I while I didn’t tackle every project on my summer to do list, we are starting the year off a little more organized than last year.&#160; So, even though I am not ready for the early mornings and the long afternoons… I am ready for a new year. 

I can’t believe this is my 5th year of homeschooling!!&#160; That’s right I have a fourth grader now.&#160;

I also have a second grader… sporting the contacts she got this summer.&#160; Definitely a new look for her (and her doll Molly).&#160; She also lost a new tooth this weekend!

And last, but not least, my 1st grader!&#160; She was almost literally bouncing off the walls with excitement this morning… ready to start another school year.

I hope and pray that it is a good year for all of us and that we grow closer to each other and to the Lord as we seek to do this school year well.&#160;
